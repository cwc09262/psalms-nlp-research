Psalter 103 (49.03%):
  Bless the Lord, O my soul. O Lord my God, Thou art become exceeding magnified. Thou hast put on praise and majesty, Who coverest Thyself with light as with a garment, Who stre
tchest out the heavens like a curtain; Who supporteth His chambers in the waters. Who appointeth the clouds for His ascent; who walketh upon the wings of the wind. Who maketh 
His angels spirits, and His ministers a flaming fire. Who hath established the earth upon its sure foundation; it shall not be moved for ever and ever. The deep like a garment
 is his mantle; the waters shall stand upon the mountains. At Thy rebuke they shall flee; at the voice of Thy thunder they shall be afraid. The mountains rise up, and the plai
ns go down unto the place which Thou hast founded for them. Thou hast set a bound that they shall not pass over, neither turn again to cover the earth. He sendeth the springs 
into the valleys; the waters shall run among the mountains. They shall give drink to all the beasts of the field; the wild asses shall wait to quench their thirst. By them sha
ll the fowls of the air make their habitation; they shall give voice from the midst of the rocks. He watereth the mountains from His chambers; the earth shall be satisfied wit
h the fruit of Thy works. He causeth the grass to grow for the cattle, and green herb for the service of men. That he may bring forth bread out of the earth: and wine maketh g
lad the heart of man. To make his face cheerful with oil: and bread strengtheneth man's heart. The trees of the plain shall be satisfied, the cedars of Lebanon which Thou hast
 planted. There shall the sparrows make their nests; the house of the heron is chief among them. The high mountains are a refuge for the harts, and so is the rock for the hare
s. He hath made the moon for seasons; the sun knoweth his going down. Thou appointedst darkness, and there was night, wherein all the beasts of the forest shall go abroad. You
ng lions roaring after their prey, and seeking their meat from God. The sun ariseth, and they are gathered together, and they shall lay them down in their dens. But man shall 
go forth unto his work, and to his labour until the evening. O Lord, how magnified are Thy works! In wisdom hast Thou made them all; the earth is filled with Thy creation. So 
is this great and wide sea, wherein are things creeping innumerable, creatures small and great. There go the ships, there this dragon, whom Thou hast made to play therein. All
 things look unto Thee, that Thou mayest give them their meat in due season. When Thou givest it them, they shall gather it; when Thou openest Thine hand, all things shall be 
filled with goodness. When Thou turnest away Thy face, they shall be troubled; Thou shalt take away their breath, and they shall fail, and return to their dust. Thou shalt sen
d forth Thy Spirit, and they shall be created, and Thou shalt renew the face of the earth. Let the glory of the Lord endure unto the ages; the Lord shall rejoice in His works.
 He looketh upon the earth, and maketh it tremble; He toucheth the mountains, and they smoke. I will sing unto the Lord as long as I live, I will sing praise to my God while I
 have my being. Let my words be pleasing unto Him; and I will be glad in the Lord. O that sinners might be consumed out of the earth, and the workers of iniquity, so that they
 be no more. Bless thou the Lord, O my soul. Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit, both now and ever, and unto the ages of ages. Amen. Alleluia, alle
luia, alleluia, glory to Thee, O God. Alleluia, alleluia, alleluia, glory to Thee, O God. Alleluia, alleluia, alleluia, glory to thee, O God. Lord, have mercy; Lord, have merc

Psalter 112 (48.59%):
  Praise the Lord, ye servants; praise the name of the Lord. Blessed be the name of the Lord, from this time forth and for evermore. From the rising of the sun to the going down
 of the same, the Lord's name is to be praised. The Lord is high above all nations; His glory is above the heavens. Who is like unto the Lord our God, Who dwelleth on high, an
d beholdeth the things that are lowly in heaven, and in the earth? Who raiseth up the poor from the earth, and lifteth the needy out of the dunghill, That He may set him with 
princes, even with the princes of His people. Who maketh the barren woman to dwell in a house, a mother rejoicing over children.

Bible 71 (48.42%):
  For Solomon OGod give Your judgments to the King And Your righteousness to the Kings Son That He may judge Your people in righteousness And Your poor with judgment Let the mou

arth The Ethiopians shall bow down before Him And His enemies shall lick the dust The kings of Tarshish and their islands will come bearing gifts The kings of Arabia and Saba 
will bring presents All the kings of the earth shall worship Him All the Gentiles shall serve Him For He rescued the poor from the hand of a strong man And the needy for whom 
there was no helper He shall spare the poor and needy And He shall save the souls of the needy He shall redeem their souls from usury and injustice And precious shall be their
 name in His sight He shall live and there shall be given Him from the gold of Arabia They shall pray continually because of Him All the day long shall they bless Him He shall
 be a support on the earth upon the summits of the mountains His fruit shall be exalted more than Lebanon And they shall flourish from the city like the grass of the earth Let
 His name be blessed unto the ages His name shall remain before the sun And all the tribes of the earth shall be blessed in Him All the Gentiles shall bless Him Blessed is the
 Lord God The God of Israel who alone does wondrous things And blessed is the name of His glory forever and unto ages of ages And all the earth shall be filled with His glory

  Bless the Lord, O my soul. O Lord my God, Thou art become exceeding magnified. Thou hast put on praise and majesty, Who coverest Thyself with light as with a garment, Who stre

His angels spirits, and His ministers a flaming fire. Who hath established the earth upon its sure foundation; it shall not be moved for ever and ever. The deep like a garment
 is his mantle; the waters shall stand upon the mountains. At Thy rebuke they shall flee; at the voice of Thy thunder they shall be afraid. The mountains rise up, and the plai

 planted. There shall the sparrows make their nests; the house of the heron is chief among them. The high mountains are a refuge for the harts, and so is the rock for the hare

His angels spirits, and His ministers a flaming fire. Who hath established the earth upon its sure foundation; it shall not be moved for ever and ever. The deep like a garment
 is his mantle; the waters shall stand upon the mountains. At Thy rebuke they shall flee; at the voice of Thy thunder they shall be afraid. The mountains rise up, and the plai
ns go down unto the place which Thou hast founded for them. Thou hast set a bound that they shall not pass over, neither turn again to cover the earth. He sendeth the springs 
into the valleys; the waters shall run among the mountains. They shall give drink to all the beasts of the field; the wild asses shall wait to quench their thirst. By them sha
ll the fowls of the air make their habitation; they shall give voice from the midst of the rocks. He watereth the mountains from His chambers; the earth shall be satisfied wit
h the fruit of Thy works. He causeth the grass to grow for the cattle, and green herb for the service of men. That he may bring forth bread out of the earth: and wine maketh g
lad the heart of man. To make his face cheerful with oil: and bread strengtheneth man's heart. The trees of the plain shall be satisfied, the cedars of Lebanon which Thou hast
 planted. There shall the sparrows make their nests; the house of the heron is chief among them. The high mountains are a refuge for the harts, and so is the rock for the hare
s. He hath made the moon for seasons; the sun knoweth his going down. Thou appointedst darkness, and there was night, wherein all the beasts of the forest shall go abroad. You
ng lions roaring after their prey, and seeking their meat from God. The sun ariseth, and they are gathered together, and they shall lay them down in their dens. But man shall 
go forth unto his work, and to his labour until the evening. O Lord, how magnified are Thy works! In wisdom hast Thou made them all; the earth is filled with Thy creation. So 
is this great and wide sea, wherein are things creeping innumerable, creatures small and great. There go the ships, there this dragon, whom Thou hast made to play therein. All
 things look unto Thee, that Thou mayest give them their meat in due season. When Thou givest it them, they shall gather it; when Thou openest Thine hand, all things shall be 
filled with goodness. When Thou turnest away Thy face, they shall be troubled; Thou shalt take away their breath, and they shall fail, and return to their dust. Thou shalt sen
d forth Thy Spirit, and they shall be created, and Thou shalt renew the face of the earth. Let the glory of the Lord endure unto the ages; the Lord shall rejoice in His works.
 He looketh upon the earth, and maketh it tremble; He toucheth the mountains, and they smoke. I will sing unto the Lord as long as I live, I will sing praise to my God while I
 have my being. Let my words be pleasing unto Him; and I will be glad in the Lord. O that sinners might be consumed out of the earth, and the workers of iniquity, so that they
 be no more. Bless thou the Lord, O my soul. Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit, both now and ever, and unto the ages of ages. Amen. Alleluia, alle
luia, alleluia, glory to Thee, O God. Alleluia, alleluia, alleluia, glory to Thee, O God. Alleluia, alleluia, alleluia, glory to thee, O God. Lord, have mercy; Lord, have merc

  Bless the Lord, O my soul. O Lord my God, Thou art become exceeding magnified. Thou hast put on praise and majesty, Who coverest Thyself with light as with a garment, Who stre
tchest out the heavens like a curtain; Who supporteth His chambers in the waters. Who appointeth the clouds for His ascent; who walketh upon the wings of the wind. Who maketh 
His angels spirits, and His ministers a flaming fire. Who hath established the earth upon its sure foundation; it shall not be moved for ever and ever. The deep like a garment
 is his mantle; the waters shall stand upon the mountains. At Thy rebuke they shall flee; at the voice of Thy thunder they shall be afraid. The mountains rise up, and the plai
ns go down unto the place which Thou hast founded for them. Thou hast set a bound that they shall not pass over, neither turn again to cover the earth. He sendeth the springs 
into the valleys; the waters shall run among the mountains. They shall give drink to all the beasts of the field; the wild asses shall wait to quench their thirst. By them sha
ll the fowls of the air make their habitation; they shall give voice from the midst of the rocks. He watereth the mountains from His chambers; the earth shall be satisfied wit
h the fruit of Thy works. He causeth the grass to grow for the cattle, and green herb for the service of men. That he may bring forth bread out of the earth: and wine maketh g
lad the heart of man. To make his face cheerful with oil: and bread strengtheneth man's heart. The trees of the plain shall be satisfied, the cedars of Lebanon which Thou hast
 planted. There shall the sparrows make their nests; the house of the heron is chief among them. The high mountains are a refuge for the harts, and so is the rock for the hare
s. He hath made the moon for seasons; the sun knoweth his going down. Thou appointedst darkness, and there was night, wherein all the beasts of the forest shall go abroad. You
ng lions roaring after their prey, and seeking their meat from God. The sun ariseth, and they are gathered together, and they shall lay them down in their dens. But man shall 
go forth unto his work, and to his labour until the evening. O Lord, how magnified are Thy works! In wisdom hast Thou made them all; the earth is filled with Thy creation. So 
is this great and wide sea, wherein are things creeping innumerable, creatures small and great. There go the ships, there this dragon, whom Thou hast made to play therein. All
 things look unto Thee, that Thou mayest give them their meat in due season. When Thou givest it them, they shall gather it; when Thou openest Thine hand, all things shall be 
filled with goodness. When Thou turnest away Thy face, they shall be troubled; Thou shalt take away their breath, and they shall fail, and return to their dust. Thou shalt sen
d forth Thy Spirit, and they shall be created, and Thou shalt renew the face of the earth. Let the glory of the Lord endure unto the ages; the Lord shall rejoice in His works.
 He looketh upon the earth, and maketh it tremble; He toucheth the mountains, and they smoke. I will sing unto the Lord as long as I live, I will sing praise to my God while I
 have my being. Let my words be pleasing unto Him; and I will be glad in the Lord. O that sinners might be consumed out of the earth, and the workers of iniquity, so that they

  Bless the Lord, O my soul. O Lord my God, Thou art become exceeding magnified. Thou hast put on praise and majesty, Who coverest Thyself with light as with a garment, Who stre
tchest out the heavens like a curtain; Who supporteth His chambers in the waters. Who appointeth the clouds for His ascent; who walketh upon the wings of the wind. Who maketh 
His angels spirits, and His ministers a flaming fire. Who hath established the earth upon its sure foundation; it shall not be moved for ever and ever. The deep like a garment
 is his mantle; the waters shall stand upon the mountains. At Thy rebuke they shall flee; at the voice of Thy thunder they shall be afraid. The mountains rise up, and the plai

into the valleys; the waters shall run among the mountains. They shall give drink to all the beasts of the field; the wild asses shall wait to quench their thirst. By them sha

lad the heart of man. To make his face cheerful with oil: and bread strengtheneth man's heart. The trees of the plain shall be satisfied, the cedars of Lebanon which Thou hast
 planted. There shall the sparrows make their nests; the house of the heron is chief among them. The high mountains are a refuge for the harts, and so is the rock for the hare
s. He hath made the moon for seasons; the sun knoweth his going down. Thou appointedst darkness, and there was night, wherein all the beasts of the forest shall go abroad. You

 things look unto Thee, that Thou mayest give them their meat in due season. When Thou givest it them, they shall gather it; when Thou openest Thine hand, all things shall be 
filled with goodness. When Thou turnest away Thy face, they shall be troubled; Thou shalt take away their breath, and they shall fail, and return to their dust. Thou shalt sen

  Bless the Lord, O my soul. O Lord my God, Thou art become exceeding magnified. Thou hast put on praise and majesty, Who coverest Thyself with light as with a garment, Who stre

His angels spirits, and His ministers a flaming fire. Who hath established the earth upon its sure foundation; it shall not be moved for ever and ever. The deep like a garment
 is his mantle; the waters shall stand upon the mountains. At Thy rebuke they shall flee; at the voice of Thy thunder they shall be afraid. The mountains rise up, and the plai

into the valleys; the waters shall run among the mountains. They shall give drink to all the beasts of the field; the wild asses shall wait to quench their thirst. By them sha

 planted. There shall the sparrows make their nests; the house of the heron is chief among them. The high mountains are a refuge for the harts, and so is the rock for the hare
s. He hath made the moon for seasons; the sun knoweth his going down. Thou appointedst darkness, and there was night, wherein all the beasts of the forest shall go abroad. You

  By David Bless the Lord O my soul O Lord my God You are magnified exceedingly You clothe Yourself with thanksgiving and majesty Who cover Yourself with light as with a garment
 Who stretch out the heavens like a curtain You are He who covers His upper chambers with waters Who makes the clouds His means of approach Who walks on the wings of the winds
 Who makes His angels spirits And His ministers a flame of fire He established the earth on its stable foundation It shall not be moved unto ages of ages The deep like a garme
nt is His covering The waters shall stand upon the mountains At Your rebuke they shall flee At the sound of Your thunder they shall be afraid The mountains rise up and the pla
ins sink down To the place You founded for them You set a boundary they shall not pass over Neither shall they return to cover the earth You are He who sends springs into the 
valley The waters shall pass between the mountains They shall give drink to all the wild animals of the field The wild asses shall quench their thirst The birds of heaven shal
l dwell beside them They shall sing from the midst of the rocks You are He who waters the mountains from His higher places The earth shall be satisfied with the fruit of Your 
works You are He who causes grass to grow for the cattle And the green plant for the service of man To bring forth bread from the earth And wine gladdens the heart of man To b
righten his face with oil And bread strengthens mans heart The trees of the plain shall be full of fruit The cedars of Lebanon which You planted There the sparrows shall make 
their nests The house of the heron takes the lead among them The high mountains are for the deer The cliff is a refuge for the rabbits He made the moon for seasons The sun kno
ws its setting You established darkness and it was night Wherein all the wild animals of the forest will prowl about The young lions roar and snatch their prey And seek their 
food from God The sun arises and they are gathered together And they shall be put to bed in their dens Man shall go out to his work And to his labor until evening O Lord Your 
works shall be magnified greatly You made all things in wisdom The earth was filled with Your creation There is this great and spacious sea The creeping things are there witho
ut number The living things are there both small and great There the ships pass through There is this dragon You formed to play therein All things wait upon You That You may g
ive them food in due season When You give it tothem they shall gather it When You open Your hand all things shall be filled with Your goodness But when You turn Your face away
 they shall be troubled When You take away their breath they shall die And return again to their dust You shall send forth Your Spirit and they shall be created And You shall 
renew the face of the earth Let the glory of the Lord be forever The Lord shall be glad in His works He looks upon the earth and makes it tremble He touches the mountains and 
they smoke I will sing to the Lord all my life I will sing to my God as long as I exist May my words be pleasing to Him And I shall be glad in the Lord May sinners cease from 
the earth And the lawless so as to be no more Bless the Lord O my soul

Psalter 103 (49.03%):
  Bless the Lord, O my soul. O Lord my God, Thou art become exceeding magnified. Thou hast put on praise and majesty, Who coverest Thyself with light as with a garment, Who stre
tchest out the heavens like a curtain; Who supporteth His chambers in the waters. Who appointeth the clouds for His ascent; who walketh upon the wings of the wind. Who maketh 
His angels spirits, and His ministers a flaming fire. Who hath established the earth upon its sure foundation; it shall not be moved for ever and ever. The deep like a garment
 is his mantle; the waters shall stand upon the mountains. At Thy rebuke they shall flee; at the voice of Thy thunder they shall be afraid. The mountains rise up, and the plai
ns go down unto the place which Thou hast founded for them. Thou hast set a bound that they shall not pass over, neither turn again to cover the earth. He sendeth the springs 
into the valleys; the waters shall run among the mountains. They shall give drink to all the beasts of the field; the wild asses shall wait to quench their thirst. By them sha
ll the fowls of the air make their habitation; they shall give voice from the midst of the rocks. He watereth the mountains from His chambers; the earth shall be satisfied wit
h the fruit of Thy works. He causeth the grass to grow for the cattle, and green herb for the service of men. That he may bring forth bread out of the earth: and wine maketh g
lad the heart of man. To make his face cheerful with oil: and bread strengtheneth man's heart. The trees of the plain shall be satisfied, the cedars of Lebanon which Thou hast
 planted. There shall the sparrows make their nests; the house of the heron is chief among them. The high mountains are a refuge for the harts, and so is the rock for the hare
s. He hath made the moon for seasons; the sun knoweth his going down. Thou appointedst darkness, and there was night, wherein all the beasts of the forest shall go abroad. You
ng lions roaring after their prey, and seeking their meat from God. The sun ariseth, and they are gathered together, and they shall lay them down in their dens. But man shall 
go forth unto his work, and to his labour until the evening. O Lord, how magnified are Thy works! In wisdom hast Thou made them all; the earth is filled with Thy creation. So 
is this great and wide sea, wherein are things creeping innumerable, creatures small and great. There go the ships, there this dragon, whom Thou hast made to play therein. All
 things look unto Thee, that Thou mayest give them their meat in due season. When Thou givest it them, they shall gather it; when Thou openest Thine hand, all things shall be 
filled with goodness. When Thou turnest away Thy face, they shall be troubled; Thou shalt take away their breath, and they shall fail, and return to their dust. Thou shalt sen
d forth Thy Spirit, and they shall be created, and Thou shalt renew the face of the earth. Let the glory of the Lord endure unto the ages; the Lord shall rejoice in His works.
 He looketh upon the earth, and maketh it tremble; He toucheth the mountains, and they smoke. I will sing unto the Lord as long as I live, I will sing praise to my God while I
 have my being. Let my words be pleasing unto Him; and I will be glad in the Lord. O that sinners might be consumed out of the earth, and the workers of iniquity, so that they
 be no more. Bless thou the Lord, O my soul. Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit, both now and ever, and unto the ages of ages. Amen. Alleluia, alle
luia, alleluia, glory to Thee, O God. Alleluia, alleluia, alleluia, glory to Thee, O God. Alleluia, alleluia, alleluia, glory to thee, O God. Lord, have mercy; Lord, have merc
y; Lord, have mercy; Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit, both now and ever, and unto the ages of ages. Amen.

Psalter 112 (48.59%):
  Praise the Lord, ye servants; praise the name of the Lord. Blessed be the name of the Lord, from this time forth and for evermore. From the rising of the sun to the going down
 of the same, the Lord's name is to be praised. The Lord is high above all nations; His glory is above the heavens. Who is like unto the Lord our God, Who dwelleth on high, an
d beholdeth the things that are lowly in heaven, and in the earth? Who raiseth up the poor from the earth, and lifteth the needy out of the dunghill, That He may set him with 
princes, even with the princes of His people. Who maketh the barren woman to dwell in a house, a mother rejoicing over children.
