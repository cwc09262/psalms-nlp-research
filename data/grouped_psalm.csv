76,Orthodox,Bible,77,Concerning understanding for Asaph Give heed O my people to my law Incline your ear to the words of my mouth I shall open my mouth in parables Ishall speak of hidden things from of old What things we heard these we also knew And our fathers described them to us It was not hidden from their children in a different generation Who declare the praises of the Lord And His mighty deeds And His wondrous things He did He raised up a testimony in Jacob And appointed a law in Israel Whatever He commanded our fathers To make these things known to their children That a different generation may know Children yet to be born And they will arise and declare these things to their children So they may put their hope in God And not forget the works of God And seek out His commandments So they may not become like their fathers A generation rebellious and embittered A generation that did not keep its heart right And its spirit was not faithful with God The sons of Ephraim who bend and shoot their bows Turned back in the day of battle They did not keep Gods covenant And they did not desire to walk in His law And they forgot His good deeds And His wonders He showed them In the sight of their fathers The marvelous things He did In the land of Egypt in the field of Zoan He parted the sea and led them through The waters stood like a dam And He led them with a cloud by day And all night by the light of a fire He split the rock in the desert And gave them water to drink as in a great deep And He brought out water from the rock And He brought it down like the waters of rivers And they still continued to sin against Him They rebelled against the Most High in a place without water And they tested God in their hearts By asking food for their souls And they slandered God and said Why is God unable to prepare a table in the desert Since He struck the rock and waters flowed And brooks flooded Is He alsounable togive us bread Or to prepare a table for His people Therefore the Lord heard and was enraged And fire was kindled in Jacob And wrath arose against Israel Because they did not believe in God Nor put their hope in His salvation And He commanded the clouds above And opened the doors of heaven And He rained manna for them to eat And gave them the bread of heaven Man ate the bread of angels He sent them food in abundance He took away the south wind from heaven And with His power He brought in the southwest wind He rained flesh on them like dust And winged birds like the sand of the sea And they fell in the midst of their camp All around their tents And they ate and were well filled And He brought them their own desire They were not deprived of their desire While their food was still in their mouth The wrath of God rose up against them And killed their wealthy ones And shackled Israels chosen ones In all these things they still sinned And did not believe in His wonders And their days ended in folly And their years with haste When He killed them they sought Him out And turned back and rose up early before God They remembered God was their helper And the Most High God their redeemer But they deceived Him with their mouth And lied to Him with their tongue For their heart was not right with Him Neither were they faithful to His covenant But He is merciful And will atone for their sins and not destroy them And He will multiply them and turn away His anger And He will not kindle all His wrath For He remembered they are flesh A spirit that is passing and not returning How many times did they rebel against Him in the desert And provoke Him to wrath in the desert And they turned away and tempted God And provoked the Holy One of Israel They did not remember His hand And the day He redeemed them from the hand of those afflicting them How He wrought His signs in Egypt And His wonders in the plains of Zoan And how He turned their rivers and rainfalls into blood So they could not drink He sent them the dogfly and it devoured them And the frog and it destroyed them He gave their fruit to the mildew And their labors to the locust He killed their vineyard with hail And their mulberry trees with frost And He delivered their cattle tothe hail And their property to the fire He sent forth the wrath of His anger to them Anger and wrath and affliction Sent forth through evil angels He made a path for His wrath He did not spare their souls from death And their cattle He enclosed in death And He struck every firstborn in Egypt The firstfruit of their labor in the tents of Ham And He brought His people out like sheep And He led them like a flock in the desert And He guided them in hope and they were not afraid And the sea covered up their enemies He brought them into the mountain of His holiness This mountain His right hand acquired And He cast out the nations from before their face And distributed them a measure of land as an inheritance And He settled the tribes of Israel in their tents They tested and rebelled against the Most High God And did not keep His testimonies And they turned away and broke His covenant just as their fathers did And they changed into a crooked bow And they provoked Him to anger with their high places And moved Him to jealousy with their carved images God heard and despised them And He utterly disdained Israel And He rejected the tabernacle at Shiloh His dwelling place where He settled among men He gave their strength into captivity And their beauty into the hands of the enemy And He gave His people over to the sword And despised His inheritance Fire consumed their young men And their virgins were not lamented Their priests fell by the sword And their widows were not lamented Then the Lord awoke as from sleep Like a strong man drunk from wine And He struck His enemies from behind He gave them eternal reproach And He rejected the dwelling of Joseph And did not choose the tribe of Ephraim He chose the tribe of Judah This Mount Zion that He loves And He built His sanctuary as the place of unicorns He founded it forever on the earth He chose David for His servant And took him from the sheepfolds He took him from behind sheep that gave birth To shepherd Jacob His people And Israel His inheritance And he shepherded them in the integrity of his heart And guided them with the skillfulness of his hands,concerning understanding asaph give heed

who keep His judgment And do righteousness at all times Remember us O Lord because of the goodwill of Your people Visit us with Your salvation So as to see it in the goodness of Your chosen ones So as to be glad with the joy of Your nation So as to praise You in the midst of Your inheritance We sinned with our fathers We committed lawlessness we acted wrongfully Our fathers did not understand Your wonders in Egypt They did not remember the multitude of Your mercy But rebelled when they went up to the Red Sea But He saved them because of His name So they might know His power And He rebuked the Red Sea and it was dried up And He led them in the sea as though it were a desert He saved them from the hands of those who hated them And redeemed them from the hand of the enemy So the water covered those who afflicted them There was not one left among them Then they believed His words And sang His praise They were quick to forget His works They did not wait for His counsel And they desired exceedingly in the desert And tempted God in a waterless place So He gave them their request And fully satisfied their souls They also angered Moses in the camp And Aaron the holy one of the Lord The earth was opened and swallowed Dathan And buried the assembly of Abiram A fire kindled in their assembly The flame burned up the sinners They made a calf in Horeb And bowed down and worshiped the graven image Thus they changed their glory Into the likeness of a calf that eats grass They forgot the God who saved them Who did great things in Egypt And marvelous things in the land of Ham Fearful things at the Red Sea And He said He would destroy them Had not Moses His chosen one Stood among them in the destruction before Him To turn away His wrath so as not to destroy them Then they despised the desired land They did not believe His word But murmured in their tents They did not listen to the Lords voice So He raised His hand against them To overthrow them in the desert And to overthrow their seed among the nations And to scatter them among the countries They were consecrated to BaalPeor And ate sacrifices of the dead So they provoked Him with their ways of living And destruction multiplied among them Then Phinehas stood among them and made atonement And the destruction ceased And it was reckoned as righteousness to him From generation to generation forever They also provoked Him to anger at the water of Rebellion And Moses was afflicted because of them For they embittered his spirit And he spoke offensively with his lips They did not destroy the nations the Lord said to destroy But mingled with the nations And learned their works And they served their graven images And this became a snare for them They also sacrificed their sons And their daughters to demons And shed innocent blood The blood of their sons and daughters Whom they sacrificed to the graven images of Canaan So the land was polluted with their blood It was also defiled by their works Thus they acted unfaithfully in their ways of living And the Lord was very angry with His people And He abhorred His inheritance Then He delivered them into the hands of the nations And those who hated them ruled over them Their enemies also afflicted them And they were humbled under their hands He delivered them many times But they rebelled against Him with their counsel And were humbled by their transgressions And He saw them in their afflictions He listened to their supplications And He remembered His covenant And felt regret according to the multitude of His mercy So He aroused compassion for them Among all who made them captives Save us O Lord our God And gather us from the nations So we may give thanks to Your holy name And boast in Your praise Bless the Lord God of Israel from

habitation Let them give thanks to the Lord for His mercies And His wonders to the sons of men For He fed the empty soul And filled the hungry soul with good things Those sitting in the darkness and

was no one to help them Then they cried out to the Lord in their afflictions And He saved them from their distresses And He brought them out of darkness and the shadow of death And broke their chains to pieces Let them give thanks to the Lord for His mercies His wonders to the sons of men For He crushed the gates of bronze And shattered the bars of iron He helped them out of their lawless ways For

sacrifice of praise And let them proclaim His works with exceeding joy Those who go down to the sea in ships Who do business in many waters These see the works of the Lord And His wonders in the deep He spoke and a stormy wind arose And its waves were lifted up They mount up to the heavens And descend into the deep Their soul is consumed with evils They were troubled they were shaken like one drunk with wine And all their wisdom was consumed Then they cried to the Lord in their affliction And He brought them out of their distresses He also commanded the storm and it became a breeze And its waves were still Then they were glad for they were silent And He guided them to the haven of their desire Let them give thanks to the Lord for His mercies And His wonders to the sons of men Let them exalt Him in the assembly of the people And praise Him in the seat of the elders He turned rivers into a desert And streams of water intodry ground A fruitful land into salt water Because of the evils of those living there He turned the desert into pools of water And a land without water into streams of water Then He caused the hungry to dwell there And established a city for habitation They sowed fields and planted vineyards And produced much fruit So He blessed them and they were multiplied exceedingly And their cattle did not diminish But they were diminished and maltreated By the affliction of evils and pain Contempt was poured out on princes And He made them wander in an impassible place where there was no road Yet He helped the poor man out of his poverty And made his families like a

For Thou hast maintained my right and my cause; Thou satest in the throne, O Thou that judgest righteousness. Thou hast rebuked the heathen, and the ungodly hath perished; Thou hast put out his name for ever and ever. The swords of the enemy have utterly failed, and Thou hast destroyed his cities. His memory hath perished with a loud noise, but the Lord endureth for ever. He hath prepared His throne for judgment, and He shall judge the world in righteousness, He shall minister judgement to the peoples in uprightness. The Lord also is become a refuge for the poor, a helper in due season in tribulations. And let them that know Thy name put their hope in Thee; for Thou, Lord, hast not forsaken them that seek Thee.

For the needy shall not alway be forgotten; the patience of the poor shall not perish for ever. Arise, O Lord, let not man prevail; let the heathen be judged in Thy sight. O Lord, set a lawgiver over them; let the nations know themselves to be but men. Why hast Thou stood afar off, O Lord? Why overlookest thou us in times of need, in troubles? Whilst the ungodly man is proud, the poor man burneth within; they are caught in the devices that they imagine. For the sinner praiseth himself for his soul's desires, and the unrighteous blesseth himself therein. The sinner hath provoked the Lord; in the multitude of his wrath he will not seek Him; God is not before him. His ways are profane at all times; Thy judgments are removed out of his sight; he will gain dominion over all his enemies. For he hath said in his heart, I shall not be moved; from generation to generation shall I be without adversity. His mouth is full of cursing and bitterness and fraud; under his tongue are toil and travail. He sitteth in ambush with the rich in secret places, that he may slay the innocent; his eyes are set against the poor. He lieth in wait secretly as a lion in his den; he lieth in wait to seize the poor, to seize the poor when he draweth him in. In his snare will he humble himself; he will crouch and fall when he gaineth mastery over the poor. For he hath said in his heart, God hath forgotten; He hath turned away His face, that He may never see. Arise, O Lord my God, let Thine hand be lifted up; forget not Thy poor to the end. Wherefore hath the ungodly provoked God? for he hath said in his heart, He will not require it. Thou seest it, for Thou beholdest toil and wrath, to deliver him into Thy hands.

And the earth shook and trembled, the foundations also of the mountains were troubled and were moved, because God was wroth with them. There went up a smoke in His wrath, and fire from His countenance set all aflame; coals were kindled from it. He bowed the heavens also, and came down, and thick darkness was under His feet. And He ascended upon the cherubim, and did fly; yea, He did fly upon the wings of the wind. And He made darkness His secret place, His tabernacle round about Him, dark water in the clouds of the air. At the brightness that was before Him, the clouds passed; hail stones and coals of fire. The Lord also thundered out of heaven, and the Highest gave His voice. Yea, He sent out His arrows, and scattered them; and He multiplied lightnings, and discomfited them. And the springs of waters were seen, and the foundations of the world were discovered, at Thy rebuke, O Lord, at the breath of the spirit of Thy wrath. He sent from on high, and took me; He received me out of many waters. He shall deliver me from my strong enemies, and from them which hate me, for they are too strong for me. They prevented me in the day of my calamity, but the Lord was my stay. He brought me forth also into refreshment; He will deliver me, because He delighted in me. And the Lord shall reward me according to my righteousness, and according to the cleanness of my hands will He recompense me. For I have kept the ways of the Lord, and have not done wickedly against my God. For all His judgments are before me, and His statutes have not departed from me.

It is God that hath girded me with strength, and made my way blameless. That maketh my feet like harts' feet, and setteth me upon high places. He teacheth my hands to war; and Thou hast made mine arms as a bow of brass. Thou hast also given me the shield of salvation, and Thy right hand hath holden me up. And Thine instruction hath corrected me unto the end; Thine instruction it is that shall teach me. Thou hast enlarged my steps under me, and my footsteps are not weakened. I will pursue mine enemies, and overtake them; neither shall I turn again until they be consumed. I will afflict them, and they shall not be able to rise; they shall fall under my feet.

O my God, I will cry in the daytime, but Thou wilt not hear; and in the night season, and it shall not be imputed unto folly in me. But Thou dwellest in the holy place, O Thou praise of Israel. Our fathers hoped in Thee; they hoped, and Thou didst deliver them. They cried unto Thee, and were saved; they hoped in Thee, and were not put to shame.

All they that saw me laughed me to scorn; they spake with their lips, they shook their heads, saying, He hoped in the Lord, let Him deliver him; let Him save him, seeing He delighteth in him. For Thou are He that took me out of the womb; my hope from my mother's breasts. I was cast upon Thee from the womb. Thou art my God from my mother's belly. Stand not aloof from me, For trouble is near, for there is none to help me. Many bullocks have compassed me; fat bulls have beset me round. They opened their mouths against me, as a ravening and roaring lion. I am poured out like water, and all my bones are scattered; my heart is become like wax melting in the midst of my bowels. My strength is dried up like a potsherd, and my tongue hath cleaved to my throat; and Thou hast brought me down into the dust of death. For many dogs have compassed me, and the assembly of the wicked hath inclosed me. They pierced my hands and my feet, they told all my bones; and they looked and stared upon me. They parted my garments among them, and cast lots upon my vesture. But, remove not Thou Thy help far from me O Lord; look to my help. Deliver my soul from the sword, mine only begotten one from the hand of the dog. Save me from the lion's mouth, and my lowliness from the horns of unicorns.

But Thy right hand, and Thine arm, and the light of Thy countenance, because Thou hadst a favour unto them. Thou art Thyself my King and my God, that commandest the salvation of Jacob.

Thou hast made us to turn back before our enemies, and they which hated us spoiled for themselves. Thou hast given us like sheep appointed to be eaten, and hast scattered us among the heathen. Thou hast sold Thy people for nought, and there was no profit in our selling. Thou hast made us a reproach to our neighbours, a scorn and derision to them that are round about us. Thou hast made us a byword among the heathen, a shaking of the head among the peoples.

I am come into the deeps of the sea, and a tempest hath overwhelmed me. I am weary of my crying, my throat is become hoarse, my eyes have failed from hoping in my God. They that hate me without a cause are multiplied more than the hairs of my head; mine enemies are grown strong that persecute me unjustly; then I restored that which I took not away. O God, Thou knowest my foolishness, and my trespasses are not hid from Thee. Let not those that wait on Thee, O Lord, Thou Lord of hosts, be ashamed for my sake; nor let them that seek Thee be confounded for my sake, O God of Israel. Because for Thy sake I have borne reproach; shame hath covered my face. I am become a stranger unto my brethren, and an alien unto my mother's sons. For the zeal of Thine house hath eaten me up, and the reproaches of them that reproach Thee are fallen upon me. And I covered my soul with fasting, and that was made a reproach unto me. I made sackcloth also my garment, and I became a byword unto them. They that sit in the gate spake against me, and they that drink wine made me their song. But as for me, with my prayer will I cry unto Thee, O Lord, at the time of Thy good pleasure. O God, in the multitude of Thy mercy hear me, in the truth of Thy salvation. Save me from the mire, that I may not stick fast; let me be delivered from them that hate me, and out of the deep waters. Let not the waterflood overwhelm me, neither let the deep swallow me up, and let not the pit shut her mouth upon me. Hear me, O Lord, for Thy mercy is good; look upon me according to the multitude of Thy tender mercies. Turn not Thy face away from Thy servant, for I am in trouble; hear me speedily. Draw nigh unto my soul, and redeem it; deliver me because of mine enemies. For Thou knowest my reproach, and my shame, and my dishonour. All they that trouble me are before Thee. My soul hath expected eproach and misery; and I looked for one that would grieve with me, but there was none; and for one that would comfort me, but found I none. They gave me also gall for my meat, and for my thirst they gave me vinegar to drink. Let their table become a snare before them, for a recompense, and for a stumbling block. Let their eyes be darkened, that they see not, and bow down their back continually. Pour out Thy wrath upon them, and let Thy wrathful anger take hold of them. Let their habitation be made desolate, and let none dwell in their tents. For they persecuted him whom Thou hast smitten, and they have added to the pain of my wounds. Add iniquity unto their iniquity, and let them not come into Thy righteousness. Let them be blotted out of the book of the living, and not be written with the righteous. I am poor and sorrowful; let Thy salvation, O God, be quick to help me. I will praise the name of my God with a song; I will magnify Him with praise. And this shall please God better than a young calf that hath horns and hoofs. Let the needy see this, and be glad; seek ye God, and your soul shall live.

222,Orthodox,Psalter,72,"How good is God to Israel, even to such as are of an upright heart. But as for me, my feet were almost gone, my steps had well nigh slipped. Because I was envious at the transgressors, when I saw the peace of sinners. For they show no refusal in their death, and they are steadfast in their stripes. They are not in labours as other men, neither shall they be scourged with other men. Therefore their pride hath held them fast; they have covered themselves with their injustice and ungodliness. Their injustice shall go forth, as out of fatness; they have come into their heart's desire. They have thought and spoken wickedly; they have spoken unrighteousness loftily. They have set their mouth against heaven, and their tongue walketh through the earth. Therefore shall my people return hither, and full days shall be found in them. And they said, How doth God know? and is there knowledge in the Most High? Behold, these are the sinners; they prosper in this age, and have obtained riches. And I said, Verily I have justified my heart in vain, and washed my hands in innocency. For all the day long have I been as a man scourged, and reproof was mine every morning. If I said, I will speak thus, behold, I had broken covenant with the generation of Thy children. And I sought to know this, but it is a labour in my sight. Until I come into the sanctuary of God, and understand their end. Verily Thou hast appointed evils for them for their crafty dealings; Thou castedst them down when they were lifted up. How are they brought to desolation in a moment! They are consumed; they have perished because of their iniquity. As a dream of one that awaketh, O Lord, so in Thy city shalt Thou despise their image. For my heart was on fire, and my reins were changed. And I was brought to nothing, and I knew it not. I became as a beast before Thee, yet I am always with Thee. Thou hast holden me by my right hand, and hast guided me with Thy counsel, and received me with glory. For what have I in heaven, and what have I desired upon the earth beside Thee?

Remember Thy congregation, which Thou hast purchased from the beginning. Thou hast redeemed the rod of Thine inheritance, this Mount Zion wherein Thou hast dwelt. Lift up Thy hands against their perpetual pride, against all that the enemy hath done wickedly in Thy sanctuary. And they that hate Thee have made their boast in the midst of Thy feast. They set up their ensigns for signs, though they knew it not, in the entrances on high. As in a forest of trees, they have cut down at once the doors thereof with axes; they have broken it down with axe and hammer.

Or will God forget to shew mercy? or will He in His wrath shut up His tender mercy for ever? And I said, Now have I begun; this change is of the right hand of the Most High.

227,Orthodox,Psalter,77,"Give heed, O my people, to my law; incline your ear to the words of my mouth. I will open my mouth in parables; I will utter dark sayings of old; Which we have heard and have known, and our fathers have told us. They were not hid from their children in another generation; they declared the praises of the Lord, and His mighty acts, and His wonderful works that He hath done. And He raised up a testimony in Jacob, and appointed a law in Israel, Even those things which He commanded our fathers, that they should make them known to their children; That another generation might know them, even the children which should be born; that they should arise, and declare them to their children. That they might set their hope in God, and not forget the works of God; but seek His commandments. That they might not be as their fathers, a perverse and provoking generation, A generation that set not their heart aright, and kept not their spirit stedfast with God. The children of Ephraim, bending and shooting the bow, turned back in the day of battle. They kept not the covenant of God, and refused to walk in His law. They forgat His benefits, and His wonders that He had shewed them, Marvellous things that He did in the sight of their fathers, in the land of Egypt, in the field of Tanis. He divided the sea, and brought them through; He made the waters stand as in a wineskin. In the daytime also He led them with a cloud, and all the night with a light of fire. He clave the rock in the wilderness, and gave them to drink as out of a great deep. He brought water also out of the rock, and brought down waters as rivers. And they sinned yet more against Him; they provoked the Most High in the place without water. And they tempted God in their hearts, by asking meat for their souls. Yea, they spake against God, and said, Can God not furnish a table in the wilderness? Because He smote a rock, and waters gushed out, and the torrents overflowed: can not He give bread also, or furnish a table for His people? Therefore the Lord heard this, and was provoked; and a fire was kindled in Jacob, and wrath also came up against Israel. Because they believed not in God, and hoped not in His salvation. And He commanded the clouds from above, and opened the doors of heaven, And He rained down manna upon them to eat, and gave them bread of heaven. Man ate the bread of angels; He sent them provision to the full. He removed the south wind from heaven, and by His power brought in the south west wind. He rained flesh also upon them as dust, and feathered fowls like as the sands of the sea, Which fell in the midst of their camp, round about their habitations. And they did eat, and were well filled, and He gave them their own desire; and they were not disappointed of their lust. But while the meat was yet in their mouths, the wrath of God rose up against them, and He slew the fat among them, and fettered the chosen men of Israel. In all these things they sinned yet more, and believed not for His wondrous works. And their days were consumed in vanity, and their years in haste. When He slew them, then they sought Him, and they returned and called early unto God. And they remembered that God was their helper, and the Most High God their redeemer. Yet they did love Him only with their mouth, and they lied to Him with their tongue. For their heart was not right with Him, neither were they stedfast in His covenant. But He is full of compassion, and will forgive their sins, and will destroy them not. And many a time will He turn His anger away, and not kindle all His wrath. And He remembered that they were but flesh, a breath that passeth away, and cometh not again. How oft did they provoke Him in the wilderness, and anger Him in the land without water! They turned back and tempted God, and provoked the Holy One of Israel. They remembered not His hand, nor the day when He redeemed them from the hand of the oppressor. How He had wrought His signs in Egypt, and His wonders in the field of Tanis. And He turned their rivers into blood; and their showers, that they might not drink. He sent the dog fly against them, which devoured them; and the frog, which destroyed them. He gave also their fruits unto the cankerworm, and their labours unto the locust. And He destroyed their vineyards with hail, and their mulberry trees with frost. And He gave up their cattle also to the hail, and their substance to the fire. And He sent against them the wrath of His anger; anger, and wrath, and trouble, a mission of evil angels. He made a way to His wrath, and spared not their souls from death, but shut up their cattle in death, And smote all the firstborn in Egypt, the firstfruits of all their labour in the tabernacles of Ham. And He took away His people like sheep, and led them in the wilderness like a flock. And He guided them in hope, and they feared not; and the sea overwhelmed their enemies. And He brought them into the mountain of His sanctuary, even to this mountain which His right hand had purchased. He cast out the heathen also before them, and divided them an inheritance by lot, And made the tribes of Israel to dwell in their tents. Yet they tempted and provoked the Most High God, and kept not His testimonies, But turned back, and brake covenant, like their fathers; they became like a crooked bow. And they provoked Him to anger among their hills, and moved Him to jealousy with their graven images. God heard, and regarded them no more, and greatly abhorred Israel. And He forsook His tabernacle at Shiloh, His dwelling where He dwelt among men. And delivered their strength into captivity, and their beauty into the enemy's hands. He shut up his people also with a sword, and regarded His inheritance no more. Fire consumed their young men, and their maidens made no lamentation. Their priests fell by the sword, and none shall weep for their widows. Then the Lord awaked as one out of sleep, and like a mighty man that hath been heated with wine. And He smote His enemies on their hinder parts; He put them to a perpetual reproach. Moreover, He refused the tabernacle of Joseph, and chose not the tribe of Ephraim; But He chose the tribe of Judah, the Mount Zion which He loved. And He built His sanctuary like that of an unicorn; He established it upon the earth for ever. He chose David also His servant, and took him from the flocks of sheep. From following the ewes great with young He took him, to shepherd Jacob His servant, and Israel His inheritance. So he shepherded them in the innocency of his heart, and guided them by the skilfulness of his hands.","give heed , people , law ; incline ear word mouth . open mouth parable ; utter dark saying old ; heard known , father told u . hid child another generation ; declared praise lord , mighty act , wonderful work hath done . raised testimony jacob , appointed law israel , even thing commanded father , make known child ; another generation might know them , even child born ; arise , declare child . might set hope god , forget work god ; seek commandment . might father , perverse provoking generation , generation set heart aright , kept spirit stedfast god . child ephraim , bending shooting bow , turned back day battle . kept covenant god , refused walk law . forgat benefit , wonder shewed them , marvellous thing sight father , land egypt , field tanis . divided sea , brought through ; made water stand wineskin . daytime also led cloud , night light fire . clave rock wilderness , gave drink great deep . brought water also rock , brought water river . sinned yet him ; provoked high place without water . tempted god heart , asking meat soul . yea , spake god , said , god furnish table wilderness ? smote rock , water gushed out , torrent overflowed : give bread also , furnish table people ? therefore lord heard this , provoked ; fire kindled jacob , wrath also came israel . believed god , hoped salvation . commanded cloud above , opened door heaven , rained manna upon eat , gave bread heaven . man ate bread angel ; sent provision full . removed south wind heaven , power brought south west wind . rained flesh also upon dust , feathered fowl like sand sea , fell midst camp , round habitation . eat , well filled , gave desire ; disappointed lust . meat yet mouth , wrath god rose them , slew fat among them , fettered chosen men israel . thing sinned yet more , believed wondrous work . day consumed vanity , year haste . slew them , sought him , returned called early unto god . remembered god helper , high god redeemer . yet love mouth , lied tongue . heart right him , neither stedfast covenant . full compassion , forgive sin , destroy not . many time turn anger away , kindle wrath . remembered flesh , breath passeth away , cometh again . oft provoke wilderness , anger land without water ! turned back tempted god , provoked holy one israel . remembered hand , day redeemed hand oppressor . wrought sign egypt , wonder field tanis . turned river blood ; shower , might drink . sent dog fly them , devoured them ; frog , destroyed them . gave also fruit unto cankerworm , labour unto locust . destroyed vineyard hail , mulberry tree frost . gave cattle also hail , substance fire . sent wrath anger ; anger , wrath , trouble , mission evil angel . made way wrath , spared soul death , shut cattle death , smote firstborn egypt , firstfruits labour tabernacle ham . took away people like sheep , led wilderness like flock . guided hope , feared not ; sea overwhelmed enemy . brought mountain sanctuary , even mountain right hand purchased . cast heathen also them , divided inheritance lot , made tribe israel dwell tent . yet tempted provoked high god , kept testimony , turned back , brake covenant , like father ; became like crooked bow . provoked anger among hill , moved jealousy graven image . god heard , regarded more , greatly abhorred israel . forsook tabernacle shiloh , dwelling dwelt among men . delivered strength captivity , beauty enemy 's hand . shut people also sword , regarded inheritance more . fire consumed young men , maiden made lamentation . priest fell sword , none shall weep widow . lord awaked one sleep , like mighty man hath heated wine . smote enemy hinder part ; put perpetual reproach . moreover , refused tabernacle joseph , chose tribe ephraim ; chose tribe judah , mount zion loved . built sanctuary like unicorn ; established upon earth ever . chose david also servant , took flock sheep . following ewe great young took him , shepherd jacob servant , israel inheritance . shepherded innocency heart , guided skilfulness hand ."

They have brought Thy people low, O Lord, and afflict Thine inheritance. They have slain the widow and the fatherless, and have murdered the stranger.

The trees of the plain shall be satisfied, the cedars of Lebanon which Thou hast planted. There shall the sparrows make their nests; the house of the heron is chief among them. The high mountains are a refuge for the harts, and so is the rock for the hares. He hath made the moon for seasons; the sun knoweth his going down. Thou appointedst darkness, and there was night, wherein all the beasts of the forest shall go abroad. Young lions roaring after their prey, and seeking their meat from God. The sun ariseth, and they are gathered together, and they shall lay them down in their dens. But man shall go forth unto his work, and to his labour until the evening.

So is this great and wide sea, wherein are things creeping innumerable, creatures small and great. There go the ships, there this dragon, whom Thou hast made to play therein. All things look unto Thee, that Thou mayest give them their meat in due season. When Thou givest it them, they shall gather it; when Thou openest Thine hand, all things shall be filled with goodness.

Seek the Lord, and be strengthened; seek His face at all times. Remember His marvellous works that He hath done; His wonders, and the judgments of His mouth. O ye seed of Abraham His servant, ye sons of Jacob His chosen. He is the Lord our God; His judgments are in all the earth. He hath remembered His covenant for ever, the word which He commanded to a thousand generations; Which He made with Abraham, and His oath unto Isaac. And confirmed the same unto Jacob for a law, and to Israel for an everlasting covenant. Saying, Unto thee will I give the land of Canaan, the lot of your inheritance. When they were but few in number, very few, and sojourners therein. And they went from one nation to another, and from one kingdom to another people. He suffered no man to do them wrong; yea, He reproved kings for their sake; Saying, Touch not Mine anointed, and do My prophets no evil. Moreover He called for a famine upon the land; He brake the whole staff of bread. He sent a man before them, even Joseph, who was sold for a slave. Whose feet they humbled with fetters; his life was spent in irons, until his word came to pass. The word of the Lord tried him; the king sent and loosed him, even the ruler of the people, and let him go free. He made him lord of his house, and ruler of all his substance; To instruct his princes as himself, and teach his elders wisdom. Israel also came into Egypt, and Jacob sojourned in the land of Ham. And He increased His people greatly, and made them stronger than their enemies. He turned their heart to hate His people, and to deal subtilly with His servants. He sent Moses His servant, and Aaron whom He had chosen. He established the words of His signs among them, and His wonders in the land of Ham. He sent darkness, and made it dark; for they were embittered against His words. He turned their waters into blood, and slew their fish. Their land brought forth frogs in abundance, in the inner chambers of their kings. He spake, and the dog fly came, and gnats in all their coasts. He gave them hail for rain, and flaming fire in their land. He smote their vines also and their fig trees, and brake all the trees of their coasts. He spake, and the locust came, and the caterpiller, and that without number, And did eat up all the grass in their land, and devoured all the fruit of their land. He smote also all the firstborn in their land, the first fruits of all their labour. He brought them forth also with silver and gold, and there was not one feeble person among their tribes. Egypt was glad when they departed, for the fear of them fell upon them. He spread a cloud for a covering for them, and fire to give them light in the night.

255,Orthodox,Psalter,105,"O give thanks unto the Lord, for He is good; for His mercy endureth for ever. Who shall utter the mighty acts of the Lord? Who shall make all His praises to be heard? Blessed are they that keep judgment, and do righteousness at all times. Remember us, O Lord, with Thy favour that Thou bearest untor Thy people; O visit us with Thy salvation. That we may see the good of Thy chosen, that we may be glad in the gladness of Thy nation, that we may glory with Thine inheritance. We have sinned with our fathers, we have committed iniquity, we have done unrighteously. Our fathers understood not Thy wonders in Egypt, and they remembered not the multitude of Thy mercy; but provoked Thee as they went up by the Red Sea. Nevertheless He saved them for His name's sake, that He might make His mighty power to be known. He rebuked the Red Sea also, and it was dried up; so He led them into the depths, as in a wilderness. And He saved them from the hand of him that hated them, and redeemed them from the hand of the enemy. The waters covered those that afflicted them; there was not one of them left. Then believed they His words, and sang His praise. They made haste, they forgat His works, they waited not for His counsel; But lusted exceedingly in the wilderness, and tempted God in the place without water. And He gave them their request, and sent fulness into their souls. They provoked Moses also in the camp, and Aaron, the holy one of the Lord. The earth opened and swallowed up Dathan, and covered the company of Abiram. And a fire was kindled in their company; a flame burned up the wicked. And they made a calf in Horeb, and worshipped the graven thing. Thus they changed His glory into the likeness of a calf that eateth grass. And they forgat God who had saved them, who had done great things in Egypt, Wondrous works in the land of Ham, terrible things at the Red Sea. And He said that He would destroy them, had not Moses His chosen stood before Him in the breach, to turn away His wrath, lest He should destroy them. Yea, they despised the desirable land; they believed not His word; But murmured in their tents; they hearkened not unto the voice of the Lord. Therefore He lifted up His hand against them, to overthrow them in the wilderness; to overthrow their seed also among the nations, and to scatter them in the lands. They were made initiates also of Baalpeor, and ate the sacrifices of the dead. And they provoked Him to anger with their inventions, and destruction was multiplied among them. And Phinehas stood up and made propitiation, and the plague abated. And that was counted to him for righteousness, from generation to generation for evermore. They provoked Him also at the waters of strife, and Moses was hurt for their sakes. Because they provoked his spirit, and he spake unadvisedly with his lips. They did not destroy the nations, concerning whom the Lord commanded them; But were mingled among the heathen, and learned their works; and they served their graven things, and it became a scandal unto them. Yea, they sacrificed their sons and their daughters unto demons, and shed innocent blood, even the blood of their sons and of their daughters, whom they sacrificed unto the graven things of Canaan. And the land was murderously defiled with blood, and it was polluted with their own works, and they went a whoring with their own inventions. Therefore was the wrath of the Lord kindled against His people, and He abhorred His own inheritance. And He gave them into the hands of their enemies, and they that hated them had dominion over them. Their enemies also afflicted them, and they were brought into subjection under their hand. Many times did He deliver them, but they provoked Him with their counsel, and were brought low in their iniquities. Nevertheless the Lord regarded them in their affliction, and heard their supplication. And He remembered His covenant, and repented according to the multitude of His mercy. He made them to be pitied in the sight of all those that had taken them captive. Save us, O Lord our God, and gather us from among the heathen, that we may give thanks to Thy holy name, that we may glory in Thy praise.

256,Orthodox,Psalter,106,"O give thanks unto the Lord, for He is good; for His mercy endureth for ever. Let them that have been redeemed of the Lord say so, whom He hath redeemed from the hand of the enemy, and gathered them out of the lands: from the east, and from the west, and from the north, and from the sea. They wandered in the wilderness, in a waterless land; they found not the way to a city of habitation. Hungry and thirsty, their soul fainted in them. And they cried unto the Lord in their affliction, and He delivered them out of their distresses. And He led them forth into the right way, that they might go to a city of habitation. Let them praise the Lord for His mercies, and for His wonderful works to the sons of men. For He hath satisfied the empty soul, and filled the hungry soul with goodness. Such as sit in darkness and in the shadow of death, bound in poverty and iron, Because they rebelled against the words of God, and provoked the counsel of the Most High. Their heart also was brought down with labours; they waxed feeble, and there was none to help. And they cried unto the Lord in their affliction, and He saved them out of their distresses. And He brought them out of darkness, and the shadow of death; and brake their bonds asunder. Let them praise the Lord for His mercies, and for His wonderful works to the sons of men. For He hath broken in pieces the gates of brass, and shattered the bars of iron. He helped them out of the way of their transgressions, for they were brought low because of their iniquities. Their soul abhorred all manner of food, and they drew near unto the gates of death. And they cried unto the Lord in their affliction, and He saved them out of their distresses. He sent his Word, and healed them, and delivered them from their corruption. Let them praise the Lord for His mercies, and for His wonderful works to the sons of men. And let them sacrifice to Him a sacrifice of praise, and declare His works with rejoicing. They that go down to the sea in ships, that do business in great waters; These men have seen the works of the Lord, and His wonders in the deep. He spake the word, and a stormy wind arose; and the waves thereof were lifted up. They mount up to the heavens, and they go down into the depths; their soul was melted away with evils. They were troubled, and they staggered as a drunken man; and all their wisdom was swallowed up. And they cried unto the Lord in their affliction, and He brought them out of their distresses. And He commanded the storm, and it was calmed into a breeze, and the waves thereof fell silent. And they were glad, because they were stilled; and He guided them to the haven of His will. Let them praise the Lord for His mercies, and for His wonderful works to the sons of men. Let them exalt Him in the congregation of the people, and praise Him in the seat of the elders. He hath turned rivers into a wilderness, and the streams of waters into dry ground; A fruitful land into saltness, for the wickedness of them that dwell therein. He turned a wilderness into pools of waters, and a parched land into streams of waters. And there He made the hungry to dwell, and they prepared cities for habitation, And they sowed fields, and planted vineyards, which yielded fruits of increase. He blessed them also, so that they were multiplied greatly; and He suffered not their cattle to decrease. And again, they were minished and brought low through affliction, evils, and sorrows. Contempt was poured upon their princes; and He caused them to wander in a wilderness, where there is no way. Yea, He helped the poor out of his poverty, and made his families like a flock.

This is the Lord's doing, and it is marvellous in our eyes. This is the day which the Lord hath made; let us rejoice and be glad in it. Save now, O Lord; O Lord, send now prosperity. Blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord; we have blessed you out of the house of the Lord.

268,Orthodox,Psalter,118,"Blessed are they that are blameless in the way, who walk in the law of the Lord. Blessed are they that search out His testimonies; they shall seek Him with their whole heart. For they that work iniquity have not walked in His ways. Thou hast commanded us to keep Thy commandments most diligently. O that my ways may be directed to keep Thy statutes! Then shall I not be ashamed, when I have respect unto all Thy commandments. I will praise Thee with uprightness of heart, when I shall have learned the judgments of Thy righteousness. I will keep Thy statutes; O forsake me not utterly. Wherewithal shall a young man correct his way? by keeping Thy words. With my whole heart have I sought Thee; cast me not away from Thy commandments. Thy words have I hid in my heart, that I might not sin against Thee. Blessed art Thou, O Lord; teach me Thy statutes. With my lips have I declared all the judgments of Thy mouth. I have had delight in the way of Thy testimonies, as much as in all riches. I will meditate in Thy commandments, and understand Thy ways. I will meditate in Thy statutes; I will not forget Thy words. Give recompense unto Thy servant; quicken Thou me, and I shall keep Thy words. Uncover Thou mine eyes, and I shall behold wondrous things out of Thy law. I am a sojourner upon the earth; hide not Thy commandments from me. My soul hath longed to desire Thy judgments at all times. Thou hast rebuked the proud; cursed are they which do err from Thy commandments. Remove from me reproach and contempt, for I have sought Thy testimonies. For princes did sit and speak against me, but Thy servant did meditate in Thy statutes. For Thy testimonies are my meditation, and Thy statutes are my counsels. My soul hath cleaved unto the ground; quicken Thou me according to Thy word. I have declared my ways, and Thou heardest me; teach me Thy statutes. Make me to understand the way of Thy statutes, and I will meditate upon Thy wondrous works. My soul hath slumbered for heaviness; strengthen Thou me in Thy words. Remove from me the way of unrighteousness, and have mercy upon me with Thy law. I have chosen the way of truth, and have not forgotten Thy judgments. I have cleaved unto Thy testimonies; O Lord, put me not to shame. I have run the way of Thy commandments, when Thou didst enlarge my heart. Set before me for a law, O Lord, the way of Thy statutes; and I shall seek it out continually. Give me understanding, and I shall search Thy law; yea, I will observe it with my whole heart. Guide me in the path of Thy commandments, for I have longed for it. Incline my heart unto Thy testimonies, and not to covetousness. Turn away my eyes, that I behold not vanity; quicken Thou me in Thy way. Stablish Thy word unto Thy servant, in fear of Thee. Take away my reproach, which I have feared, for Thy judgments are good. Behold, I have longed after Thy commanments; quicken me in Thy righteousness. Let Thy mercy come also upon me, O Lord, even Thy salvation according to Thy word. So shall I make answer to them that reproach me, for I have hoped in Thy words. And take not Thou the word of truth utterly out of my mouth, for I have hoped in Thy judgments. So shall I keep Thy law continually for ever and ever. And I walked at liberty, for I sought Thy commandments. I spake of Thy testimonies also before kings, and was not ashamed. And I meditated in Thy commandments, which I have greatly loved. My hands also have I lifted up unto Thy commandments, which I have loved; and I meditated in Thy statutes. Remember Thy words unto Thy servant, upon which Thou hast caused me to hope. This hath comforted me in my humiliation, for Thy word hath quickened me. The proud have transgressed exceedingly, yet have I not declined from Thy law. I remembered Thy judgments of old, O Lord, and was comforted. Despondency hath taken hold upon me, because of the sinners who forsake Thy law. Thy statutes have been my songs in the place of my sojourning. I have remembered Thy name, in the night, O Lord, and have kept Thy law. This happened to me, because I diligently sought Thy statutes. Thou art my portion, O Lord; I have said that I would keep Thy law. I entreated Thy face with my whole heart; have mercy upon me according to Thy word. I have thought on Thy ways, and turned my feet unto Thy testimonies. I made ready, and was not troubled, that I might keep Thy commandments. The cords of sinners have compassed me, but I have not forgotten Thy law. At midnight I rose to give thanks unto Thee, because of the judgments of Thy righteousness. I am a companion of all them that fear Thee, and of them that keep Thy statutes. The earth, O Lord, is full of Thy mercy; teach me Thy statutes. Thou hast dealt graciously with Thy servant, O Lord, according to Thy word. Teach me goodness and discipline and knowledge, for I have believed Thy commandments. Before I was humbled, I went astray; therefore have I kept Thy word. Thou art good, O Lord, and in Thy goodness teach me Thy statutes. The unrighteousness of the proud is multiplied against me, but I will search Thy commandments with my whole heart. Their heart is curdled like milk, but I have meditated in Thy law. It is good for me that Thou hast humbled me, that I might learn Thy statutes. The law of Thy mouth is better to me than thousands of gold and silver. Thy hands have made me and fashioned me; O give me understanding, and I shall learn Thy commandments. They that fear Thee shall see me, and be glad; for I have hoped in Thy words. I have known, O Lord, that Thy judgments are right, and with truth Thou hast humbled me. O let Thy mercy now be for my comfort, according to Thy word unto Thy servant. Let Thy tender mercies come unto me, and I shall live; for Thy law is my meditation. Let the proud be ashamed, for they have transgressed against me unjustly; but I will meditate in Thy commandments. Let those that fear Thee return unto me, and those that know Thy testimonies. Let my heart be blameless in Thy statutes, that I be not ashamed. My soul fainteth for Thy salvation; I have hoped in Thy words. Mine eyes have failed with waiting for Thy word, saying, O when wilt Thou comfort me? For I am become like a wineskin in the frost, yet I have not forgotten Thy statutes. How many are the days of Thy servant? When wilt Thou execute judgment for me on them that persecute me? Transgressors have told me idle tales, but they are not after Thy law, O Lord. All Thy commandments are truth: they have persecuted me wrongfully; help Thou me. They had almost made an end of me upon earth, but I forsook not Thy commandments. Quicken me according to Thy mercy, and I will keep the testimonies of Thy mouth. For ever, O Lord, Thy word endureth in heaven. Thy truth is from generation to generation; Thou hast established the earth, and it abideth. The day continueth according to Thine ordinance; for all things are Thy servants. If Thy law had not been my meditation, then I should have perished in my humiliation. I will never forget Thy statutes, for in them Thou hast quickened me. MIDDLE I am Thine, O save me; for I have sought Thy statutes. Sinners have waited for me to destroy me, but I have understood Thy testimonies. I have seen an end of all perfection; Thy commandment is exceeding broad. O how have I loved Thy law, O Lord! It is my meditation all the day long. Thou through Thy commandment hast made me wiser than mine enemies, for it is mine for ever. I have more understanding than all my teachers, for Thy testimonies are my meditation. I have more understanding than mine elders, because sought Thy commandments. I have refrained my feet from every evil way, that I might keep Thy words. I have not departed from Thy judgments, for Thou hast appointed a law for me. How sweet are Thy words unto my throat! yea, sweeter than honey to my mouth. From Thy commandments have I gained understanding; therefore I have hated every unrighteous way. Thy law is a lamp unto my feet, and a light unto my paths. I have sworn, and am steadfastly purposed, that I will keep the judgments of Thy righteousness. I have been humbled very much; quicken me, O Lord, according unto Thy word. Be pleased with the freewill offerings of my mouth, O Lord, and teach me Thy judgments. My soul is continually in Thy hands, yet I have not forgotten Thy law. Sinners have laid a snare for me, yet I erred not from Thy commandments. Thy testimonies have I taken as an heritage for ever, for they are the joy of my heart. I have inclined my heart to perform Thy statutes for ever, for a recompense. I have hated transgressors, but Thy law have I loved. Thou art my helper and defender; I have hoped in Thy words. Depart from me, ye evildoers, and I will search out the commandments of my God. Hold Thou me up according to Thy word, and quicken me; and turn me not away in shame from mine expectation. Help me, and I shall be saved; and I will meditate in Thy statutes continually. Thou hast despised all them that depart from Thy statutes, for their inward thought is unrighteous. I have accounted as transgressors all the sinners of the earth; therefore have I loved Thy testimonies. Nail down my flesh with the fear of Thee, for I am afraid of Thy judgments. I have done judgment and justice; give me not over unto them that wrong me. Receive Thy servant unto good; let not the proud accuse me falsely. Mine eyes have failed with waiting for Thy salvation, and for the word of Thy righteousness. Deal with Thy servant according to Thy mercy, and teach me Thy statutes. I am Thy servant; give me understanding, and I shall know Thy testimonies. It is time for the Lord to act, for they have made void Thy law. Therefore have I loved Thy commandments above gold and topaz. Therefore have I directed myself according to all Thy commandments; I have hated every unrighteous way. Thy testimonies are wonderful; therefore hath my soul sought them. The unfolding of Thy words shall give light and understanding unto infants. I opened my mouth, and drew in my breath; for I longed for Thy commandments. Look Thou upon me, and be merciful unto me, according to the judgment of them that love Thy name. Order my steps according to Thy word, and let not any iniquity have dominion over me. Deliver me from the false accusation of men, and I will keep Thy commandments. Make Thy face to shine upon Thy servant, and teach me Thy statutes. Mine eyes have sent forth streams of waters, because I kept not Thy law. Righteous art Thou, O Lord, and upright are Thy judgments. Thy testimonies that Thou hast commanded are very righteousness and truth. My zeal for Thee hath made me to pine away, because mine enemies have forgotten Thy words. Thy word hath been tried in the fire to the uttermost, and Thy servant hath loved it. I am young and despised, yet have I not forgotten Thy statutes. Thy righteousness is an everlasting righteousness, and Thy law is truth. Troubles and anguish are come upon me, yet Thy commandments are my meditation. Thy testimonies are righteousness for ever; give me understanding, and I shall live. I cried with my whole heart; hear me, O Lord, and I shall seek Thy statutes. I cried unto Thee; save me, and I shall keep Thy testimonies. I arose before the dawn, and cried; I hoped in Thy words. Mine eyes awoke before the morning, that I might meditate in Thy words. Hear my voice according to Thy mercy, O Lord; quicken me according to Thy judgment. They have drawn nigh that persecute me unlawfully; they are far from Thy law. Thou art near, O Lord, and all Thy ways are truth. Concerning Thy testimonies have I known of old that Thou hast founded them for ever. Consider my humiliation, and deliver me; for I have not forgotten Thy law. Judge Thou my cause, and redeem me; quicken me for Thy word's sake. Salvation is far from sinners, for they have not sought Thy statutes. Many are Thy tender mercies, O Lord; quicken me according to Thy judgment. Many are they that persecute me and afflict me, yet have I not turned aside from Thy testimonies. I beheld men acting foolishly, and pined away; because they kept not Thy words. Behold how I have loved Thy commandments; quicken me, O Lord, in Thy mercy. The beginning of Thy words is truth, and all the judgments of Thy righteousness endure for ever. Princes have persecuted me without a cause, and my heart hath been afraid because of Thy words. I will rejoice at Thy words, as one that findeth great spoil. I have hated and abhorred unrightousness, but Thy law have I loved. Seven times a day have I praised Thee because of the judgments of Thy righteousness. Much peace have they that love Thy law, and for them there is no stumbling block. Lord, I have awaited Thy salvation, and loved Thy commandments. My soul hath kept Thy testimonies, and loved them exceedingly. I have kept Thy commandments and Thy testimonies, for all my ways are before Thee, O Lord. Let my supplication come near before Thee, O Lord; give me understanding according to Thy word. Let my petition come before Thee, O Lord; deliver me according to Thy word. My lips shall pour forth an hymn when Thou hast taught me Thy statutes. My tongue shall speak of Thy words, for all Thy commandments are righteousness. Let Thy hand be near to save me, for I have chosen Thy commandments. I have longed for Thy salvation, O Lord; and Thy law is my meditation. My soul shall live, and shall praise Thee; and Thy judgments shall help me. I have gone astray like a lost sheep; seek Thy servant, for I have not forgotten Thy commandments.","blessed blameless way , walk law lord . blessed search testimony ; shall seek whole heart . work iniquity walked way . thou hast commanded u keep thy commandment diligently . way may directed keep thy statute !

He giveth His snow like wool; He scattereth the mist like ashes. He casteth forth His ice like morsels; who shall stand before His cold? He shall send out His word, and melt them; His wind shall blow, and the waters shall flow. He sheweth His word unto Jacob, His statutes and His judgments unto Israel. He hath not dealt so with every nation, neither hath He shewed His judgments unto them.","praise lord , jerusalem ; praise thy god , zion . hath strengthened bar thy gate ; hath blessed thy child within thee . maketh peace thy border , filleth thee fat wheat . sendeth forth commandment earth ; word runneth swiftly . giveth snow like wool ; scattereth mist like ash . casteth forth ice like morsel ; shall stand cold ? shall send word , melt them ; wind shall blow , water shall flow . sheweth word unto jacob , statute judgment unto israel . hath dealt every nation , neither hath shewed judgment unto them ."

300,Orthodox,Psalter,150,"Praise God in His holy ones; praise Him in the firmament of His power. Praise Him for His mighty acts; praise Him according to the multitude of His greatness. Praise Him with the sound of the trumpet; praise Him with the psaltery and harp. Praise Him with the timbrel and dance; praise Him with the strings and pipe. Praise Him with the tuneful cymbals; praise Him with the joyful cymbals. Let everything that hath breath praise the Lord. I was the least among my brethren, and the youngest in the house of my father; I shepherded my father's sheep. My hands made an instrument, and my fingers tuned a psaltery. And who shall tell my Lord? The Lord Himself shall hear. He sent His angel, and took me from my father's sheep, and anointed me with the oil of His anointing. My brethren were comely and tall, but the Lord took not pleasure in them. I went forth to meet the Philistine, and he cursed me by his idols. But I drew his own sword, and cut off his head; and I took away the reproach from the sons of Israel. THE NINE ODES THE FIRST ODE An Ode of Moses in the Exodus. (Exodus 15: 119) When he had altogether drowned Pharaoh in the deep, Moses said, Let us sing unto the Lord, for He is gloriously glorified. Let us sing unto the Lord, for He is gloriously glorified; the horse and his rider hath He thrown into the sea. He was to me a helper and protector for salvation. He is my God, and I will glorify Him; my father's God, and I will exalt Him. The Lord breaking wars; LORD is His name. Pharaoh's chariots and his hosts hath He cast into the sea; the chosen mounted captains hath He plunged into the Red Sea. He covered them with the sea; they sank into the depths as a stone. Thy right hand, O Lord, is glorified in strength; Thy right hand, O Lord, hath dashed in pieces the enemy; and in the abundance of Thy glory hast Thou crushed the adversaries. Thou sentest forth Thy wrath; it consumed them as stubble. And through the breath of Thine anger the waters parted asunder; the waters were congealed as a wall, the waves were congealed in the midst of the sea. For 14 verses The enemy said, I will pursue, I will overtake, I will divide the spoil, I will satisfy my soul, I will destroy with my sword; my right hand shall have the dominion. Thou sentest forth Thy wind, the sea covered them; they sank as lead in the mighty water. For 12 verses Who is like unto Thee, O Lord, among the gods? Who is like Thee, glorious in holiness, marvellous in glories, doing wonders? Thou stretchedst out Thy right hand; the earth swallowed them. For 10 verses Thou in Thy righteousness hast guided this Thy people which Thou hast redeemed; Thou calledst them in Thy strength to Thy holy habitation. The nations heard, and were angry; pangs took hold upon the inhabitants of Philistia. For 8 verses Then the princes of Edom made haste, the princes also of the Moabites; trembling took hold upon them; all the inhabitants of Canaan melted away. Let fear and trembling fall upon them; by the greatness of Thine arm let them become as stone, For 6 verses Till Thy people pass over, O Lord; till they pass over, this people, which Thou hast purchased. Bring them in, and plant them in the mountain of Thine inheritance; in the place, O Lord, which Thou hast made for Thee to dwell in, in the sanctuary which Thy hands have prepared. For 4 verses The Lord reigneth for ever and ever. For the horse of Pharaoh went in with his chariots and with his horsemen into the sea, and the Lord brought again the waters of the sea upon them; but the children of Israel went on dry ground in the midst of the sea. Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit, both now and ever, and unto the ages of ages. Amen. THE SECOND ODE It should be noted that the Second Ode is never chanted, except only in Great Lent, during which on Tuesday only it is chanted to the end. And for each of the troparia of the Second Ode of the Canon we say, Glory to Thee, our God, glory to Thee. An Ode of Moses in the Deuteronomy. (Deut. 32: 143) After the Law had been written, again an Ode of Moses. Attend, O ye heaven, and I will speak; and let the earth hear the words of my mouth. Let my teaching be looked for as the rain, and let my words come down as the dew, as a shower upon the grass, and as the snow upon the green herb. For I have called upon the name of the Lord. Ascribe ye majesty unto our God. As for our God, His works are true, and all His ways are judgment. God is faithful, and there is no unrighteousness in Him; just and holy is the Lord. Have not children that are blameworthy sinned against Him? O perverse and crooked generation, do ye thus requite the Lord? This is a foolish people, and unwise; did not He Himself thy Father take thee for His own, and make thee, and fashion thee? Remember the days of old, consider the years of generations and generations. Ask thy father, and he will shew thee; thine elders, and they will tell thee. When the Most High divided the nations, when He scattered the sons of Adam, He set the bounds of the nations according to the number of the angels of God. And Jacob His people became the Lord's portion; Israel was the lot of His inheritance. He satisfied him in the wilderness, in burning thirst, and in a waterless land. He led him about, He instructed him, He kept him as the apple of His eye. As an eagle watcheth over his nest, and yearneth over his young, and spreading abroad his wings, receiveth them, and taketh them up upon his back; So the Lord alone did lead them, and there was no strange God with them. He brought them up on the strength of the land; He fed them with the increase of the fields. He suckled them with honey out of the rock, and oil out of the solid rock, Butter of kine, and milk of sheep, with fat of lambs and rams, of calves and kids, with the fat of kidneys of wheat; and they drank wine, the blood of the grape. So Jacob ate, and was filled; and the beloved one kicked, he waxed fat, he grew thick and broad; then he forsook God Which made him, and departed from God his Saviour. They provoked Me to anger with strange gods, and embittered Me with their abominations. They sacrificed unto demons, not to God; to gods whom they knew not; to new gods recently arisen, whom their fathers knew not. Thou hast forsaken God that begat thee, and hast forgotten God that feedeth thee.","praise god holy one ; praise firmament power . praise mighty act ; praise according multitude greatness . praise sound trumpet ; praise psaltery harp . praise timbrel dance ; praise string pipe . praise tuneful cymbal ; praise joyful cymbal . let everything hath breath praise lord . least among brother , youngest house father ; shepherded father 's sheep . hand made instrument , finger tuned psaltery . shall tell lord ? lord shall hear . sent angel , took father 's sheep , anointed oil anointing . brother comely tall , lord took pleasure them . went forth meet philistine , cursed idol . drew sword , cut head ; took away reproach son israel . nine ode first ode ode moses exodus .
