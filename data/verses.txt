Blessed is the man Who walks not in the counsel of the ungodly Nor stands in the way of sinners Nor sits in the seat of the troublesome
But his will is in the law of the Lord And in His law he meditates day and night
He shall be like a tree Planted by streams of waters That produces its fruit in its season And his leaf shall not wither And whatever he does shall prosper
Not so are the ungodly not so But they are like the dust the wind drives from the face of the earth
Therefore the ungodly shall not rise in the judgment Nor sinners in the counsel of the righteous
For the Lord knows the way of the righteous But the way of the ungodly shall perish
Why do the nations rage And the people meditate on vain things
The kings of the earth set themselves And the rulers gather together Against the Lord and against His anointed saying
Let us break their bands And cast away their yokes from us
He who sits in the heavens shall laugh at them The Lord shall mock them
Then shall He speak to them in His wrath And trouble them in His anger
But I was established as King by Him Over His holy hill of Zion Declaring the Lords decree
The Lord said to Me You are My Son Today I have begotten You
Ask of Me and I will give You The nations for Your inheritance And the ends of the earth for Your possession
You shall shepherd them with an iron staff You shall shatter them like a potters vessel
And now O kings understand Be instructed all you judges of the earth
Serve the Lord with fear And rejoice in Him with trembling
Lay hold of His instruction lest the Lord be angry And you perish from the righteous way When His fury shall be quickly kindled Blessed are all who trust in Him
A psalm by David when he fled from the face of his son Absalom OLord why do those who afflict me multiply Many are those who rise up against me
Many are those who say to my soul There is no salvation for him in his God Pause
But You O Lord are my protector My glory and the One who lifts up my head
I cried to the Lord with my voice And He heard me from His holy hill Pause
I lay down and slept Iawoke for the Lord will help me
I will not be afraid of ten thousands of people Who set themselves against me all around
Arise O Lord and save me O my God For You struck all those who were foolishly at enmity with me You broke the teeth of sinners
Salvation is of the Lord And Your blessing is upon Your people
For the End in psalms an ode by David You heard me when Icalled O God of my righteousness You strengthened my heart when I was in distress Have mercy on me and hear my prayer
How long O you sons of men Will you be slow of heart Why do you love vain things And seek after lies
Know that the Lord made His Holy One wondrous The Lord will hear me when I cry to Him
Be angry and do not sin Have remorse upon your beds For what you say in your hearts Pause
Offer the sacrifice of righteousness And hope in the Lord
There are many who say Who will show us good things O Lord the light of Your face was stamped upon us
You put gladness in my heart From their season of wheat wine and oil they were multiplied
I will both sleep and rest in peace For You alone O Lord cause me to dwell in hope
For the End concerning the inheritance a psalm by David Give ear tomy words O Lord Hear my cry
Give heed to the voice of my supplication My King and my God For to You will I pray O Lord
In the morning You shall hear my voice In the morning I will stand before You And I will watch
For You are not a God who wills lawlessness Nor shall the evildoer dwell with You
The lawless shall not stand before Your eyes You hate all the workers of lawlessness
You shall destroy all who speak falsehood The Lord abhors the man of violence and deceit
But as for me in the fullness of Your mercy I will come into Your house In fear of You I will worship toward Your holy temple
Lead me O Lord in Your righteousness because of my enemies Make straight Your way before me
For there is no truth in their mouth Their heart is vain Their throat is an open grave They deal deceptively with their tongues
Judge them O God Let them fall by their false accusations Cast them out in the multitude of their ungodliness For they provoked You O Lord
But let all who hope in You be glad They will greatly rejoice forever For You will dwell in them And all who love Your name will boast in You
For You will bless the righteous O Lord You crowned us with the shield of Your goodwill
For the End in hymns concerning the eighth a psalm by David OLord do not reprove me in Your anger Nor discipline me in Your wrath
Have mercy on me O Lord for I am weak Heal me O Lord for my bones are troubled
And my soul is greatly troubled But You O Lord how long
Return O Lord and deliver my soul Save me because of Your mercy
For there is no remembrance of You in death And in Hades who will give thanks to You
I am weary with my groaning Every single night Iwill dampen my bed I will drench my couch with my tears
My eye is troubled by anger I grow old among all my enemies
Depart from me all you workers of lawlessness For the Lord heard the voice of my weeping
The Lord heard my supplication The Lord received my prayer
Let all my enemies be ashamed and greatly troubled Let them turn back and be suddenly ashamed
1A psalm by David which he sang to the Lord concerning the words of Cush the son of  Benjamin OLord my God in You I hope Save me from all who pursue me and deliver me
Lest like a lion he snatch away my soul While there is none to redeem or save
O Lord my God if I have done this If there is wrongdoing in my hands
If I dealt back evil to those dealing evil to me Then may I fall empty because of my enemies
Then may the enemy pursue and overtake my soul And trample down my life to the ground And make my glory settle in the dust Pause
Arise O Lord in Your anger Be exalted to the very boundaries of my enemies Awaken O Lord my God in the ordinance You commanded
So the congregation of the peoples shall surround You And because of this return on high
The Lord shall judge the people Judge me O Lord according to my righteousness And according to the innocence within me
Bring an end to the wickedness of sinners And keep straight the righteous For God examines hearts and reins
My righteous help is from God Who saves the upright in heart
God is a righteous strong and patient judge Not bringing down wrath every single day
If You do not return he will polish his sword He stretched his bow and readied it
And he readied his instruments of death And prepared his arrows to kindle a fire
Behold he suffered the pains of childbirth in unrighteousness He conceived pain and brought forth lawlessness
He opened up a pit and dug it out And he will fall into the hole he made
The pain shall return on his own head And his wrongdoing shall come down on his crown
I will give thanks to the Lord according to His righteousness And will sing to the name of the Lord Most High
For the End concerning the winepresses a psalm by David OLord our Lord how wondrous is Your name in all the earth For Your splendor is exalted far beyond the heavens
From the mouths of babies and nursing infants You prepared praise because of Your enemies That You may destroy the enemy and avenger
For I shall look at the heavens the works of Your fingers The moon and stars You established
What is man that You remember him Or the son of man that You visit him
You made him a little lower than the angels You crowned him with glory and honor
You set him over the works of Your hands You subjected all things under his feet
All sheep and oxen And besides these alsothe animals of the field
The birds of heaven and the fish of the sea And the things passing through the paths of the seas
O Lord our Lord how wondrous is Your name in all the earth
For the End concerning the hidden things of the Son a psalm of David Iwill give thanks to You O Lord with my whole heart I will tell of all Your wondrous things
I will be glad and rejoice in You I will sing praise to Your name O Most High
When my enemy turns backward They shall be feeble and perish before Your face
For You maintain my judgment and my right You sit upon the throne judging in righteousness
You rebuke the nations and the ungodly man destroys himself You blotted out their name in their lifetime and unto ages of ages
The swords of the enemy are completely forsaken And You pulled down their cities Their memory was destroyed with a noise
But the Lord abides forever He prepared His throne in judgment
And He shall judge the world in righteousness He shall judge the peoples in uprightness
The Lord is also a refuge for the poor man A helper in seasons of affliction
And let those who know Your name put their hope in You For You O Lord do not forsake those who seek You
Sing to the Lord who dwells in Zion Proclaim His dealings among the nations
For He who avenges blood remembers them He does not forget the cry of the poor
Have mercy on me O Lord and see how my enemies have humbled me You who raise me up from the gates of death
That Imay proclaim all Your praises In the gates of the daughter of Zion I will rejoice in Your salvation
The nations are trapped in the destruction they caused Their foot is caught in the trap they hid
The Lord is known in the judgments He makes The sinner is caught in the works of his hands Pause
Let sinners be turned back into Hades And all the nations who forget God
For the poor man shall not be forgotten in the end The patience of the poor shall not perish forever
Arise O Lord and do not let man prevail Let the nations be judged in Your presence
Set a lawgiver over them O Lord And let the nations know that they are men Pause
Why do You stand afar off O Lord Why do You disregard me in times of affliction
When the ungodly man behaves arrogantly the poor are set afire Let him be caught in the counsels he ponders
For the sinner praises himself in the desires of his soul And the unjust man blesses himself
The sinner provokes the Lord He will not seek Him out because of the fullness of His wrath God is not before him
His ways are defiled in every season Your judgments are removed from his face He shall rule over all his enemies
For he said in his heart I will not be shaken From generation to generation I will be without trouble
His mouth is full of cursing bitterness and deceit Suffering and pain are under his tongue
He lies in ambush with the wealthy He kills the innocent in hidden places His eyes look intently at the poor
He lies in ambush in a hiding place like a lion in his den He lies in wait toseize the poor man To seize the poor man to drag him away
He will humble him in his snare But he will bend down and fall when he rules over the poor
For he said in his heart God forgets He turned His face so as never to see it
Arise O Lord God let Your hand be lifted high And do not forget Your poor
Why has the ungodly man provoked God For he said in his heart You will never call me to account for this
But You do see You do perceive the suffering and pain That You might deliver them into Your hands Therefore the poor man will be left to You You give help to the orphan
Break the arm of the sinner and the evil man His sin shall be sought and because of it he will not be found
The Lord will reign But you O nations you will perish from His earth
The Lord hears the desire of the poor Your ear heeds the readiness of their heart
To judge the orphan and the humble That man may no longer increase his great boasting upon the earth
For the End a psalm by David In the Lord I trust How will you say to my soul Flee to the mountains like a sparrow
See the sinners stretch tight their bow They prepare their arrows in the quiver That in a moonless night they may shoot down the upright in heart
For the things You created they destroyed But what did the righteous man do
The Lord is in His holy temple The Lord His throne is in heaven His eyes are fixed upon the poor man His eyelids examine the sons of men
The Lord examines the righteous man and the ungodly man And he who loves unrighteousness hates his own soul
He shall rain down snares upon sinners Fire and brimstone and a raging wind shall be the portion of their cup
The righteous Lord loves righteousness His face beholds the upright
For the End concerning the eighth a psalm by David Save me O Lord for the holy man has ceased The truthful are diminished from among the sons of men
Each one speaks useless things to his neighbor Deceptive lips speak with a double heart
May the Lord destroy all deceptive lips And the tongue that speaks boastful things
Saying We will make our tongue powerful Our lips are our own Who is lord over us
Because of the suffering of the needy And because of the groaning of the poor Now I will arise says the Lord Iwill establish them in salvation I will declare it boldly
The words of the Lord are pure words Like silver fired in a furnace of earth Purified seven times
You shall guard us O Lord You shall preserve us from this generation forever
The ungodly walk in a circle In Your exaltation You highly exalted the sons of men
For the End a psalm by David How long O Lord Will You forget me to the end How long will You turn Your face from me
How long will I take counsel in my soul Having grief in my heart daily How long will my enemy be exalted over me
Look upon me and hear me O Lord my God Enlighten my eyes lest I sleep in death
Lest my enemy say I prevailed against him Those who afflict me greatly rejoice if I am shaken
But I hope in Your mercy My heart shall greatly rejoice in Your salvation I will sing to the Lord who shows kindness to me I will sing to the name of the Lord Most High
For the End a psalm by David The fool says in his heart There is no God They are corrupt they are abominable in their habits There is none not even one who does good
The Lord stooped down from heaven to look upon the sons of men To see if there were any who understood or sought God
All turned aside and were altogether corrupted There was not even one doing good no not one Their throat is an open tomb They deal deceptively with their tongues The poison of serpents is under their lips Whose mouth is full of curses and bitterness Their feet are swift to shed blood Affliction and suffering are in their ways And the way of peace they have not known There is no fear of God before their eyes
Doall the workers of lawlessness not know They eat up my people as they eat bread and they do not call upon the Lord
They were in great fear where no fear was Because God is in the righteous generation
You shamed the counsel of the poor man Because the Lord is his hope
Who will bring about the salvation of Israel out of Zion When the Lord returns His people from captivity Let Jacob greatly rejoice and let Israel be glad
A psalm by David OLord who shall dwell in Your tabernacle Who shall live in Your holy mountain
He who walks blamelessly and works righteousness And speaks truth in his heart
Who does not deceive with his tongue Neither does evil to his neighbor And does not find fault with those nearest him
He disdains those who do evil in his presence But he holds in honor those who fear the Lord He swears an oath to his neighbor and does not set it aside
He does not lend his money at interest And he does not take a bribe against the innocent
He who does these things shall never be shaken
A pillar inscription by David Preserve me O Lord because I hope in You
I said to the Lord You are my Lord You have no need of my good things
To the saints on His earth In them He magnified all His will
Their diseases were multiplied They hastened after these things I will not join in their assemblies of blood nor will I remember their names with my lips
The Lord is the portion of my inheritance and my cup You are He who restores my inheritance to me
Portions fell to me among the best And my inheritance is the very finest
I will bless the Lord who caused me to understand Moreover until night my reins also instructed me
I saw the Lord always before me Because He is at my right hand that I may not be shaken
Therefore my heart was glad And my tongue rejoiced exceedingly My flesh also shall dwell in hope
For You will not abandon my soul to Hades Nor allow Your Holy One to see corruption
You made known to me the ways of life You will fill me with gladness in Your presence At Your right hand are pleasures forevermore
A prayer of David Listen O Lord of my righteousness Attend tomy supplication Give ear to my prayer that is not with deceitful lips
From Your face let my judgment come Let my eyes behold uprightness
You tested my heart when You visited me in the night You tried me in the fire and found nothing unjust in me
That my mouth might not speak of the works of men I held to hard ways because of the words of Your lips
Restore my steps in Your paths That my footsteps may not slip
I cried out because You listened to me O God Incline Your ear tome and hear my words
Magnify Your mercies O You who save those who hope in You From those who rise up against Your right hand
Keep me as the apple of Your eye In the shelter of Your wings You will shelter me
From the face of the ungodly who trouble me My enemies surrounded my soul
Their fat enclosed them Their mouth spoke arrogantly
Casting me out they now surround me They set their eyes to bend down to the earth
They seized me like a lion ready to tear its prey Like a young lion lurking in secret places
Arise O Lord outrun them and trip up their heels Rescue my soul from the ungodly And Your sword from the enemies of Your hand
O Lord destroy them from the earth Scatter them in their life Their belly is filled with Your hidden things They are satisfied with their sons And they leave their possessions to their children
As for me in righteousness I shall behold Your face I shall be satisfied when Your glory is revealed
1For the End by the child of the Lord David what things he spoke to the Lord even the words of this ode in the day the Lord delivered him from the hand of all his enemies and  from the hand of Saul 2thus he said I will love You O Lord my strength
The Lord is my foundation my refuge my deliverer My God is my helper on Him I will hope My champion the horn of my salvation and my protector
I will call upon the Lord and praise Him And I shall be saved from my enemies
The anguish of death surrounded me The floods of the lawless troubled me greatly
The anguish of Hades encircled me The snares of death ran me down
In my affliction I called upon the Lord And I cried out to my God He heard my voice from His holy temple And my cry shall come before Him into His ears
Then the earth was shaken and was trembling And the foundations of mountains were stirred up And they were shaken because God was angry with them
Smoke ascended in His wrath And burst into flame from His face Coals were kindled by Him
He bowed heaven and descended And darkness was under His feet
And He rode upon the cherubim and flew He flew upon the wings of the wind
He made darkness His hiding place His tabernacle was around Him Dark water in the clouds of the sky
Because of the brightness before Him the clouds The hail and the fiery coals passed through
The Lord thundered from heaven The Most High gave forth His voice
And He sent forth His arrows and scattered them And He multiplied lightning and threw them into utter confusion
Then the springs of the waters were seen And the foundations of the world were uncovered By Your rebuke O Lord By the breathing of the breath of Your wrath
He sent from on high and He took me He drew me out of many waters
He will deliver me from my strong enemies and from those who hate me Because they were too strong for me
They overran me in the day of my misfortune But the Lord became my support
And He led me into a wide place He will deliver me because He willed it for me He will deliver me from my strong enemies and from those who hate me
The Lord will reward me according to my righteousness And according to the purity of my hands He will recompense me
Because I kept the ways of the Lord And did not act impiously against my God
For all His judgments are before me And I did not remove His ordinances from me
I will also be blameless before Him And I will keep myself from my lawlessness
The Lord will reward me according to my righteousness According to the purity of my hands before His eyes
With the holy You will be holy And with the innocent man You will be innocent
And with the elect You will be elect And with the crooked You will be crooked
For You will save a humble people And You will humble the eyes of the arrogant
For You will light my lamp O Lord O my God You will enlighten my darkness
For in You I shall be delivered from ordeals And in my God I shall leap over a wall
My God His way is blameless The teachings of the Lord are tried by fire He is the shield of all who set their hope on Him
For who is God besides the Lord And who is God besides our God
It is God whogirds me with power And He made my way blameless
Who makes my feet like a deer And sets me on high places
Who teaches my hands to make war And You make my arms a bronze bow
And You gave me the shield of Your salvation And Your right hand supported me And Your instruction restored me to the end And Your instruction will teach me
You widened my steps under me And my footsteps were not feeble
I shall pursue my enemies and overtake them And I shall not turn back until they faint
I shall wound them until they cannot stand They shall fall under my feet
For You armed me with strength for war You entangled under my feet all who rose up against me
And You gave me the back of my enemies And You destroyed all who hate me
They cried out but there was none to save them Even to the Lord but He did not answer them
I will grind them fine like the dust that blows in the wind I will smooth them out like mud in the streets
Deliver me from the contradictions of the people You will establish me as the head of the Gentiles A people I never knew served me
The moment they heard they obeyed me Sons who are strangers lied to me
Sons who are strangers became old And they became lame because of their beaten path
The Lord lives and blessed is my God Let the salvation of my God be exalted
The God who vindicates me And who subdued the peoples under me
My deliverer from the rage of my enemies Because of those who rise up against me You will exalt me You will deliver me from the unrighteous man
Therefore I will give thanks to You among the Gentiles O Lord And sing to Your name
He who magnifies the salvation of His king And shows mercy to His anointed To David and his seed forever
For the End a psalm by David The heavens declare the glory of God The firmament shows the creation of His hands
Day to day utters speech And night to night reveals knowledge
There is no speech nor language Where their voices are not heard
Their proclamation went forth into all the earth And their words to the ends of the world In the sun He set His tabernacle
And it rejoices exceedingly Like a bridegroom coming forth from his bridal chamber Like a strong man to run a race
Its rising is from one end of heaven And its circuit runs to the other end And nothing shall be hidden from its heat
The law of the Lord is blameless converting souls The testimony of the Lord is trustworthy making children wise
The ordinances of the Lord are right rejoicing the heart The commandment of the Lord is bright enlightening the eyes
The fear of the Lord is pure enduring unto ages of ages The judgments of the Lord are true being altogether just
More to be desired are they than gold and a very precious stone Sweeter also than honey and the honeycomb
For indeed Your servant keeps them In keeping them there is great reward
Who will understand his transgressions Cleanse me from hidden sins
And spare your servant from unnatural sins If they have no dominion over me then I shall be blameless And I shall be cleansed from great sin
Let the words of my mouth and the meditation of my heart Be always pleasing before You O Lord my helper and my redeemer
For the End a psalm by David May the Lord hear you in the day of affliction May the name of the God of Jacob defend you
May He send you help from His holy place And may He support you from Zion
May He remember every sacrifice of yours And may your whole burnt offering be honored Pause
May He give you according to your heart May He fulfill all your counsel
We will greatly rejoice in Your salvation And in the name of our God we will be magnified
Now Iknow the Lord has saved His anointed He will hear him from His holy heaven The salvation of His right hand is mighty
Some glory in chariots some in horses But in the name of the Lord our God we shall be magnified
Their feet were tied together so they fell But we rose up and were restored
O Lord save Your King And hear us in the day we call upon You
For the End a psalm by David OLord the king shall be glad in Your power And in Your salvation he will greatly rejoice
You gave him his souls desire And You did not deprive him of his lips request Pause
For You anticipated him with blessings of goodness You placed a crown of precious stones on his head
He asked You for life and You gave it to him Length of days unto ages of ages
Great is his glory in Your salvation Glory and majesty You shall place upon him
For You shall give him blessing unto ages of ages You shall fill him with the joy of Your presence
For the king hopes in the Lord And in the mercy of the Most High he will not be shaken
May Your hand be found on all Your enemies May Your right hand find all who hate You
You shall make them like a fiery furnace In the time of Your presence The Lord shall throw them into confusion in His wrath And the fire shall devour them
You shall destroy their offspring from the earth And their seed from among the sons of men
For they vented all their evils against You They reasoned through a counsel they could not establish
For You shall make them turn their back Among Your remnants You shall make ready their countenance
Be exalted O Lord in Your power We will sing and praise Your mighty deeds
For the End concerning help in the morning a psalm by David OGod my God hear me why have You forsaken me The words of my transgressions are far from my salvation
O my God I will cry out by day but You will not hear me And by night but not for a lack of understanding in me
But You dwell among the saints O praise of Israel
Our fathers hoped in You They hoped in You and You delivered them
They cried out to You and were saved They hoped in You and were not ashamed
But I am a worm and not a man A reproach of man and despised by the people
All who see me mock me They speak with their lips and shake their head
Saying He hoped in the Lord let Him rescue him Let Him save him since He delights in him
For You are He who drew me from the womb My hope from my mothers breasts
I was cast upon You from the womb From my mothers womb You are my God
Do not stand off from me for affliction is near There is no one to help
Many young bulls surrounded me Fat bulls encircled me
They opened their mouths against me Like a raging and roaring lion
I am poured out like water And all my bones are shattered My heart is like wax melting into my stomach
My strength is dried up like an earthen vessel My tongue cleaves to my throat And You led me into the dust of death
For many dogs surrounded me An assembly of evildoers enclosed me They pierced my hands and my feet
I numbered all my bones And they look and stare at me
They divided my garments among themselves And for my clothing they cast lots
But You O Lord do not remove Your help from me Attend to my aid
Deliver my soul from the sword And my onlybegotten from the hand of the dog
Save me from the lions mouth My humiliation from the horns of the unicorns
I will declare Your name to my brethren In the midst of the church I will sing to You
You who fear the Lord praise Him All you seed of Jacob glorify Him Fear Him all you seed of Israel
For He has not despised nor scorned the beggars supplication Nor has He turned away His face from me And when I cried out to Him He heard me
My praise is from You in the great church I will pay my vows before those who fear Him
The poor shall eat and be wellfilled And those who seek Him will praise the Lord Their hearts will live unto ages of ages
All the ends of the world shall remember and turn to the Lord And all families of the Gentiles shall worship before You
For the kingdom is the Lords And He is the Master of the Gentiles
All the prosperous of the earth ate and worshiped All going down into the earth shall bow down before Him And my soul lives with Him
And my seed shall serve Him The coming generation shall be told of the Lord
And they will declare His righteousness To a people who will be born because the Lord made them
A psalm by David The Lord is my shepherd I shall not want
He makes me to lie down in green pastures He leads me beside the still waters
He restores my soul He leads me in the paths of righteousness For His names sake
Yea though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death I will fear no evil for You are with me Your rod and Your staff they comfort me
You prepare a table before me in the presence of my enemies You anoint my head with oil My cup runs over
Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me All the days of my life And I will dwell in the house of the Lord to the end of my days
A psalm by David on the first day of the week The earth is the Lords and its fullness The world and all who dwell therein
For He founded it upon the seas And prepared it upon the rivers
Who shall ascend to the mountain of the Lord Who shall stand in His holy place
He who has innocent hands and a pure heart He who does not lift up his soul to vanity He who does not swear deceitfully to his neighbor
He shall receive blessing from the Lord And mercy from the God of his salvation
This is the generation of those who seek Him Who seek the face of the God of Jacob Pause
Lift up the gates O you rulers And be lifted up you everlasting doors And the King of glory shall enter
Whois this King of glory The Lord strong and mighty The Lord powerful in battle
Lift up the gates O you rulers And be lifted up you everlasting doors And the King of glory shall enter
Who is this King of Glory The Lord of hosts He is the King of glory
A psalm by David To You O Lord I lift up my soul O my God
I trust in You let me not be ashamed Let not my enemies laugh at me
For all who wait upon You shall not be ashamed Let those be ashamed who act lawlessly in vain
Make known Your ways to me O Lord And teach me Your paths
Lead me in Your truth and teach me For You are the God of my salvation And on You I wait all the day
Remember Your compassion O Lord And Your mercy for they are from of old
Donot remember the sins of my youth nor of my ignorance But remember me according to Your mercy Because of Your lovingkindness O Lord
Good and upright is the Lord Therefore He will instruct sinners in His way
He will guide the gentle in judgment He will teach the gentle His ways
All the ways of the Lord are mercy and truth For those who seek His covenant and His testimonies
For Your names sake O Lord Pardon my sin for it is great
Whois the man whofears the Lord He will instruct him in the way He chooses
His soul shall dwell among good things His seed shall inherit the earth
The Lord is the strength of those who fear Him And to those who fear Him His name is the Lord And He will show them His covenant
My eyes are always toward the Lord For He shall pluck my feet out of the trap
Look upon me and have mercy on me For I am onlybegotten and poor
The afflictions of my heart have been widened Bring me out of my distresses
Look on my humiliation and my pain And forgive all my sins
Look on my enemies because they multiply And they hate me with unjustified hatred
Keep my soul and deliver me Let me not be ashamed because I hope in You
The innocent and the upright cleave to me Because I wait upon You O Lord
Redeem Israel O God Out of all his afflictions
Of David Judge me O Lord for I walk in my innocence And by hoping in the Lord I shall not weaken
Prove me O Lord and test me Try my reins and my heart in the fire
For Your mercy is before my eyes And I was wellpleasing in Your truth
I have not sat down with vain councils Nor will I go in with those who transgress the law
Ihate the assembly of evildoers And I will not sit with the ungodly
I will wash my hands in innocence So I will go about Your altar O Lord
That I may hear the voice of praise And tell of all Your wondrous works
O Lord I love the beauty of Your house And the place where Your glory dwells
Do not destroy my soul with the ungodly Nor my life with men of blood
In whose hands is lawlessness Their right hand is full of bribes
But as for me I walk in my innocence Redeem me and have mercy on me
For my foot stands in uprightness In the churches I will bless You O Lord
Of David before he was anointed The Lord is my light and my savior whom shall I fear The Lord is the defender of my life whom shall I dread
When the wicked drew near against me to eat up my flesh Those who afflict me and are my enemies they weakened and fell
Though an army should array itself against me my heart shall not be afraid Though war should rise up against me in this I shall hope
One thing I ask from the Lord this I will seek That I may dwell in the house of the Lord all the days of my life And behold the delights of the Lord And visit His temple
For He hid me in His tabernacle in the day of my troubles He sheltered me in the secret place of His tabernacle He set me high upon a rock
And now behold He has lifted up my head above my enemies I went around and offered in His tabernacle a sacrifice of joy Iwill sing tothe Lord and praise Him with the harp
O Lord hear my voice wherein I cry Have mercy on me and hear me
My heart speaks to You my face seeks You Your face O Lord I will seek
Do not turn away Your face from me Do not turn away from Your servant in wrath Be my helper do not utterly cast me away Nor forsake me O God my savior
For my father and my mother forsook me But the Lord laid hold of me
Instruct me O Lord in the way of Your law Set me on a straight path because of my enemies
Do not deliver me to the souls of those who afflict me For unjust witnesses rise up against me And injustice lies to itself
I believe I shall see the Lords goodness in the land of the living
Wait on the Lord Be courageous and strengthen your heart And wait on the Lord
Of David To You O Lord Icry O my God may You not pass over me in silence May You never be silent to me Else I would become like those who go down into the pit
Hear the voice of my supplication when I pray to You And when I lift up my hands toward Your holy temple
May You not associate my soul with sinners Nor destroy me with the workers of injustice Who speak peace with their neighbor But evil is in their hearts
Give them according to their works According tothe wickedness of their pursuits Give them according to the works of their hands Return to them their due reward
Because they do not understand the works of the Lord Nor the deeds of His hands You will destroy them and never rebuild them
Blessed is the Lord Because He heard the voice of my supplication
The Lord is my helper and my champion In Him my heart hoped and I was helped And my flesh revived And I will give thanks to Him willingly
The Lord is the strength of His people And the protector of the salvation of His anointed
Save Your people and bless Your inheritance And shepherd them and raise them up forever
A psalm by David the final day of the Feast of Tabernacles Bring to the Lord O you sons of God Bring to the Lord the sons of rams Bring to the Lord glory and honor
Bring to the Lord the glory due His name Worship the Lord in His holy court
The voice of the Lord is upon the waters The God of glory thundered The Lord is upon the many waters
The voice of the Lord is strong The voice of the Lord is full of majesty
The voice of the Lord shatters cedars And the Lord shall grind to powder the cedars of Lebanon
And He shall grind them fine like the young bull and like Lebanon But His beloved shall be like a son of unicorns
The voice of the Lord cuts through fiery flames
The voice of the Lord shakes the desert And the Lord will shake the desert of Kadesh
The voice of the Lord causes deer to calve And uncovers the thickets And in His temple everyone speaks of His glory
The Lord shall dwell in the deluge And the Lord shall sit as King forever
The Lord will give strength to His people The Lord will bless His people with peace
For the End the psalm of an ode at the consecration of the house by David Iwill exalt You O Lord for You lifted me up And did not let my enemies rejoice over me
O Lord my God I cry to You and You will heal me
O Lord You brought my soul out of Hades You saved me from those who go down to the pit
Sing praises to the Lord you saints of His And give thanks at the remembrance of His holiness
For there is wrath in His anger But life in His will Weeping will lodge at evening But great joy in the morning
As for me Isaid in my prosperity I shall not be shaken forever
O Lord in Your will grant beauty and power You turned away Your face and I was troubled
I shall cry to You O Lord And to God I shall make supplication
What profit is there in my blood When I go down into decay Will the dust confess You Or will it declare Your truth
The Lord heard and had mercy on me The Lord became my helper
You turned my lamentation into dancing for me You tore up my sackcloth and clothed me with gladness
That my glory may sing praise to You And not be pierced with sadness O Lord my God I shall give thanks to You forever
For the End a psalm by David of ecstasy In You O Lord I hope may I not be ashamed forever In Your righteousness deliver and rescue me
Incline Your ear to me Rescue me speedily Be to me a God who protects me And a house of refuge to save me
For You are my strength and my refuge And for Your names sake You will guide and sustain me
For You will bring me out from the snare they hid for me For You are my protector
Into Your hands I shall entrust my spirit You redeemed me O Lord God of truth
You hate those who maintain their empty vanities But I hope in the Lord
Iwill greatly rejoice and be glad because of Your mercy For You beheld my humiliation You saved my soul from distress
And did not shut me up into the hands of the enemy You set my feet in a wide place
Have mercy on me O Lord for I am afflicted My eye is troubled with anger So are my soul and my stomach
For my life is wasted with grief And my years with sighing My strength is weakened with poverty And my bones are troubled
I became a reproach among all my enemies And especially to all my neighbors And a fear to all my acquaintances Those who saw me outside fled from me
I am forgotten like one whose heart is lifeless I was made like a vessel that is utterly broken
For I heard the blame of many who dwell round about When they were gathered together against me When they plotted to take my life
But as for me I hope in You O Lord I said You are my God
My times are in Your hands Deliver me from the hand of my enemies And from those who persecute me
Make Your face shine upon Your servant Save me in Your mercy
O Lord do not let me be ashamed because I call upon You Let the ungodly be ashamed And lead them down into Hades
Let deceitful lips become speechless When they speak lawlessness against the righteous With arrogance and contempt
How great O Lord is the abundance of Your goodness You hide for those who fear You Which You will work for those whohope in You In the sight of the sons of men
You shall hide them in the secret of Your presence from the disturbance of men You will shelter them in Your tabernacle from the contradiction of tongues
Blessed is the Lord For He magnified His mercy in a fortified city
But I said in my ecstasy Indeed I am cast away from the countenance of Your eyes Therefore You heard the voice of my supplication When I cried to You
Love the Lord all you His saints For the Lord seeks out truth And He repays those who act with great arrogance
Be courageous and let your heart be strengthened All who hope in the Lord
By David concerning understanding Blessed are those whose transgressions are forgiven And whose sins are covered
Blessed is the man whose sin the Lord does not take into account And in whose mouth there is no deceit
Because I kept silent my bones grew old From my groaning all the day long
For day and night Your hand was heavy upon me I became miserable when the thorn pierced me Pause
I made known my sin And I did not hide my transgression I said I will confess my transgression to the Lord And You forgave the ungodliness of my sin Pause
For this cause everyone who is holy will pray to Him in a wellfitted time Surely they will not draw near to Him in a flood of many waters
You are my refuge from the oppression of those who surround me O my exceeding joy redeem me from those whoencircle me Pause
I will give you understanding and I will teach you in the way you should walk I will fix My eyes on you
Do not be like the horse and the mule which have no understanding You squeeze their jaws with bit and bridle Lest they come near you
Many are the scourges of the sinner But he who hopes in the Lord mercy shall encircle him
Be glad in the Lord and rejoice greatly O righteous ones And boast all you upright in heart
By David Rejoice greatly in the Lord O righteous ones Praise is fitting for the upright
Give thanks to the Lord on the lyre Sing praises to Him on a tenstringed instrument
Sing to Him a new song Sing praises beautifully with a shout
For the word of the Lord is right And all His works are done in faithfulness
He loves mercy and judgment The earth is full of the Lords mercy
By the word of the Lord the heavens were established And all the host of them by the breath of His mouth
Who gathers the waters of the sea together as in a wineskin Who put the abysses in storehouses
Let all the earth fear the Lord And let all the worlds inhabitants be shaken by Him
For He spoke and they were made He commanded and they were created
The Lord scatters abroad the counsels of the nations And He sets aside the reasoning of peoples And He rejects the counsels of rulers
The counsel of the Lord abides forever The thoughts of His heart from generation to generation
Blessed is the nation whose God is the Lord The people He chose as an inheritance for Himself
The Lord looked attentively from heaven He saw all the sons of men
From His prepared dwellingplace He looked upon all who dwell on the earth
He who alone fashioned their hearts He who understands all their works
A king is not saved by his large army And a giant shall not be saved by his immense strength
A horse is a false hope for salvation And it shall not be saved by its enormous power
Behold the eyes of the Lord are on those who fear Him On those who hope in His mercy
To deliver their souls from death And to keep them alive in famine
Our soul shall wait for the Lord He is our helper and protector
For our heart shall be glad in Him And we hope in His holy name
Let Your mercy O Lord be upon us As we hope in You
1By David when he changed his countenance before Abimelech who let him go and he  departed Iwill bless the Lord at all times His praise shall continually be in my mouth
My soul shall be praised in the Lord Let the gentle hear and be glad
Oh magnify the Lord with me And let us exalt His name together
I sought the Lord and He heard me And He delivered me from all my sojourning
Come to Him and be enlightened And your face shall never be ashamed
This poor man cried and the Lord heard him And saved him from all his afflictions
The Angel of the Lord shall encamp around those who fear Him And He will deliver them
Oh taste and see that the Lord is good Blessed is the man who hopes in Him
Fear the Lord you His saints For there is no want for those who fear Him
Rich men turned poor and went hungry But those whoseek the Lord shall not lack any good thing Pause
Come you children listen to me I will teach you the fear of the Lord
Who is the man who desires life Who loves to see good days
Keep your tongue from evil And your lips from speaking deceit
Shun evil and do good Seek peace and pursue it
The eyes of the Lord are upon the righteous And His ears are open to their supplications
The Lords face is against those who do evil So as to destroy their remembrance from the earth
The righteous cried and the Lord heard them And He delivered them from all their afflictions
The Lord is near those who are brokenhearted And He will save the humble in spirit
Many are the afflictions of the righteous But He will deliver them from them all
The Lord shall guard all their bones Not one of them shall be broken
The death of sinners is evil And those who hate the righteous shall go wrong
The Lord will redeem the souls of His servants And all who hope in Him shall not go wrong
By David OLord judge those who injure me Make war on those who make war on me
Take hold of weapon and shield and rise up to my help
Bring forth the sword and confine those in opposition who pursue me Say to my soul I am your salvation
Let those who seek my soul be dishonored and shamed Let those who plot evils against me be turned backward and disappointed
Let them be like dust in the winds face And let the Angel of the Lord afflict them
Let their way be dark and slippery And let the Angel of the Lord pursue them
For without cause they hid the destruction of their trap for me In vain they reproached my soul
Let a trap they do not know catch them And they themselves shall fall into the same trap
But my soul shall greatly rejoice in the Lord My soul shall delight in His salvation
All my bones shall say O Lord who is like You You who deliver a poor man from hands stronger than he And a poor and needy man from those who plunder him
Unjust witnesses rose up against me Asking me things I knew nothing about
They repaid me evil for good And bereavement for my soul
But I put on sackcloth when they troubled me And I humbled my soul with fasting And my prayer will return into my bosom
Like a neighbor like our brother so they were wellpleasing Like one who laments and is of a sad countenance so I humbled myself
But they were delighted and were gathered together against me Whips were gathered together against me but I did not know it They were torn asunder yet they were not pierced to the heart
They tempted me they mocked and sneered at me They gnashed their teeth at me
O Lord when will You look on this Restore my soul from their malice My onlybegotten from the lions
I will give thanks to You O Lord in the great church I will praise You among a mighty people
Let them not rejoice over me those who are unjustly my enemies Those who hate me without a cause and wink with their eyes
For they spoke peace to me But in their wrath they schemed deceit
And opened wide their mouth at me Saying Well done Well done Our eyes saw it
You saw this O Lord do not keep silence O Lord do not be far from me
Arise O Lord attend to my judgment My God and my Lord to my cause
Judge me according to Your righteousness O Lord my God And let them not rejoice against me
Let them not say in their hearts Well done Well done our soul Let them not say We swallowed him up
May those who rejoice at my troubles be altogether dishonored and shamed Let those who boast against me be clothed with shame and humiliation
Let those who desire my righteousness greatly rejoice and be glad And let them say continually The Lord be magnified Those who desire His servants peace
And my tongue shall meditate on Your righteousness And on Your praise all the day long
For the End by David the servant of the Lord The transgressor so as to sin says within himself There is no fear of God before his eyes
For he acts deceitfully before Him Lest He discover his lawlessness and hate it
The words of his mouth are lawlessness and deceit He is unwilling to understand how to do good
He devises lawlessness on his bed He sets himself in every way not good And he does not abhor evil
O Lord Your mercy is in heaven And Your truth reaches to the clouds
Your righteousness is like the mountains of God Your judgments are a great deep Men and cattle You will save O Lord
How You multiply Your mercy O God The sons of men shall hope under the shelter of Your wings
They shall be intoxicated with the fatness of Your house And You will give them drink from the abundant water of Your delight
For with You is the fountain of life In Your light we shall see light
Extend Your mercy to those who know You And Your righteousness to the upright in heart
Let not the foot of arrogance come against me And may the hand of sinners not shake me
Those who work lawlessness fall there They are cast out and unable to stand
Of David Do not be envious of those who do evil Nor be jealous of those who work lawlessness
For like grass they shall be dried up quickly And like green vegetables they shall swiftly wither
Hope in the Lord and work goodness Dwell in the land and you shall be nurtured by its riches
Delight in the Lord And He will give you the requests of your heart
Reveal your way to the Lord And hope in Him and He will do it
He shall bring forth your righteousness as light And your judgment as the noonday sun
Submit to the Lord and supplicate Him Do not be envious of him who prospers in his way Nor of him who transgresses the law
Cease from wrath and forsake anger Do not be envious so as to do evil
Because evildoers will be destroyed But those whowait on the Lord these shall inherit the earth
For in a little while the sinner shall no longer be present And you will look for his place but not find it
But the gentle shall inherit the earth And they will delight in the fullness of peace
The sinner will closely observe the just man And gnash at him with his teeth
But the Lord shall laugh at him Because He foresees his day will come
The sinners draw the sword And stretch their bow To cast down the poor and needy To slay the upright in heart
May their sword enter their heart And may their bows be shattered
Better the little with the just man Than the great riches of sinners
For the arms of sinners shall be shattered But the Lord supports the righteous
The Lord knows the ways of the blameless And their inheritance shall be forever
They shall not be ashamed in an evil time And in days of famine they shall be filled
But the sinners shall perish And the enemies of the Lord altogether When they glorify and exalt themselves Like smoke they shall vanish away
The sinner borrows but will not repay However the righteous man is compassionate and gives
For those who bless Him shall inherit the earth But those who curse Him shall be utterly destroyed
The steps of a man are guided aright by the Lord And he shall desire His way
When he falls he shall not be broken to pieces For the Lord supports him with His hand
Iwas young but indeed Igrew old Yet I have not seen the righteous forsaken Nor his seed begging bread
Day in and out he is merciful and lends And his seed shall be a blessing
Turn away from evil and do good And dwell unto ages of ages
For the Lord loves judgment And He will not abandon His holy ones They shall be kept forever But the lawless shall be banished And the seed of the ungodly shall be utterly destroyed
The righteous shall inherit the earth And dwell upon it unto ages of ages
The mouth of the righteous shall meditate on wisdom And his tongue shall speak of judgment
The law of God is in his heart And his steps shall not be tripped up
The sinner observes the righteous man And seeks to put him to death
But the Lord will not leave him in his hands Nor condemn him when He judges him
Wait on the Lord and keep His way And He shall exalt you to inherit the earth You shall see the sinners when they are utterly destroyed
Isaw the ungodly greatly exalted And lifting himself up like the cedars of Lebanon
And I passed by and behold he was not And I sought for him But his place was not found
Keep innocence and behold uprightness For this is the remnant for the peaceful man
But transgressors shall be utterly destroyed together The remnants of the ungodly shall be utterly destroyed
Now the salvation of the righteous is from the Lord And He is their protector in time of affliction
And the Lord shall help them and deliver them And He shall deliver them from sinners And save them because they hope in Him
A psalm by David for remembrance concerning the Sabbath OLord do not rebuke me in Your wrath Nor chasten me in Your anger
For Your arrows are fixed in me And Your hand rests on me
There is no healing in my flesh because of Your wrath There is no peace in my bones because of my sins
For my transgressions rise up over my head Like a heavy burden they are heavy on me
My wounds grow foul and fester Because of my folly
I suffer misery and I am utterly bowed down I go all the day long with a sad face
For my loins are filled with mockeries And there is no healing in my flesh
I am afflicted and greatly humbled I roar because of the groaning of my heart
O Lord all my desire is before You And my groaning is not hidden from You
My heart is troubled my strength fails me And the light of my eyes even this is not with me
My friends and neighbors draw near and stand against me And my near of kin stand far off
And those who seek my soul use violence And those who seek evil for me speak folly And they meditate on deceit all the day long
But I like a deaf man do not hear And I am like a mute who does not open his mouth
I am like a man who does not hear And whohas noreproofs in his mouth
For in You O Lord I hope You will hear O Lord my God
For I said Let not my enemies rejoice over me For when my foot was shaken they boasted against me
For I am ready for wounds And my pain is continually with me
For I will declare my transgression And I will be anxious about my sin
But my enemies live and are become stronger than I And those who hate me unjustly are multiplied
Those who repaid me evil for good Slandered me because I pursue righteousness And they threw away my love as though it were a stinking corpse
Do not forsake me O Lord O my God do not depart from me
Give heed to help me O Lord of my salvation
For the End for Jeduthun an ode by David Isaid I will guard my ways that I may not sin with my tongue I set a guard on my mouth When the sinner stood against me
I was deadened and humbled and I kept silent even from good And my grief was stirred anew
My heart was hot within me And in my meditation fire will be kindled I spoke with my tongue
O Lord make me to know my end And what is the measure of my days So as to know what I lack
Behold You made my days as a handbreadth And my existence is as nothing before You But all things are vanity and every man living Pause
Nevertheless man walks about like a phantom Surely in vain they stir themselves up He stores up treasure but does not know for whom he will gather it
And now what is my patience Is it not the Lord And my support is from You
Deliver me from all my transgressions You made me a reproach to the undiscerning
I was dumb and opened not my mouth For You are He who made me
Take away Your scourges from me Because of the strength of Your hand I fainted
With rebukes You chasten a man for his transgression And You cause his soul to waste away like a spider web But every man stirs himself up in vain Pause
Hear my prayer O Lord And give ear to my supplication Do not be silent at my tears For I am a sojourner before You And a stranger as were all my fathers
Do not forsake me that I may revive Before I depart and am no longer here
For the End a psalm by David Iwaited patiently for the Lord and He heeded me And He heard my supplication
And brought me up out of a miserable pit And from miry clay And He established my feet on a rock And kept straight my steps
He put a new song in my mouth A hymn to our God Many will see and be afraid And shall hope in the Lord
Blessed is the man whose hope is the name of the Lord And who did not look into vanities and false frenzies
Many O Lord my God are the wonders You performed And in Your thoughts there is no one who shall be likened to You I declared and said They are multiplied beyond number
Sacrifice and offering You did not will But a body You prepared for me A whole burnt offering and a sin offering You did not require
Then I said Behold I come it is written of me in the volume of the book
I willed to do Your will O my God And Your law in the midst of my heart
I proclaimed righteousness in the great church Behold I shall not restrain my lips O Lord You know
I did not hide Your righteousness in my heart I declared Your truth and Your salvation I did not hide Your mercy and Your truth from the great congregation
O Lord do not remove Your compassion from me May Your mercy and Your truth take hold of me continually
For evils without number surrounded me My transgressions overpowered me and I could not see They multiplied more than the hairs of my head And my heart failed me
Be pleased O Lord to deliver me O Lord give heed to help me
May those who seek my soul to make away with it Be disgraced and confounded together May those who wish evil for me be turned back and disgraced
May those who say to me Well done Well done Receive their shame immediately
May all who seek You O Lord Rejoice exceedingly and be glad in You And may those wholove Your salvation Say continually The Lord be magnified
But I am poor and needy the Lord will take care of me You are my helper and my protector O my God do not delay
For the End a psalm by David Blessed is he who understands the poor and needy The Lord will deliver him in an evil day
May the Lord keep him and give him life And make him blessed on the earth And not deliver him into the hands of his enemies
May the Lord help him on his bed of pain You turned his bed from sickness to wholeness
O Lord I said Have mercy on me Heal my soul for I have sinned against You
My enemies speak evil things against me When will he die and his name perish
And if he comes to see us he speaks in vain His heart gathered lawlessness to itself He went forth and spoke the same
All my enemies whisper together against me Against me they devise evils for me
They testify a lawless word against me Since he is asleep will he rise up again
For even the man of my peace in whom I hoped He who ate my bread dealt deceptively with me
But You O Lord have mercy on me And raise me up and I will repay them
By this I know You are pleased with me Because my enemy did not rejoice over me
And because of my innocence You supported me And established me before You forever
Blessed is the Lord God of Israel from everlasting to everlasting Amen Amen
For the End for understanding for the sons of Korah As the deer longs for the springs of waters So my soul longs for You O God
My soul thirsts for the living God When shall I come and appear before the face of God
My tears were my bread day and night When they said to me each day Where is your God
I remembered these things and poured out my soul within me For I shall enter the place of the wondrous tabernacle even the house of God To celebrate a festival with a voice of great joy and praise
Why are you so sad O my soul And why do you trouble me Hope in God for I will give thanks to Him My God is the salvation of my countenance
My soul within me was troubled Therefore I will remember You From the land of the Jordan and Hermon From the small mountain
Deep calls to deep at the sound of Your waterfalls All Your waves and billows went over me
By day the Lord shall command His mercy And by night His ode will be with me A prayer to the God of my life
I will say to God You are my protector Why have You forgotten me Why do I go about with a sad face when my enemies afflict me
Those who afflict me revile me when they break my bones When they speak to me each day saying Where is your God
Why are you so sad O my soul And why do you trouble me Hope in God for I will give thanks to Him My God is the salvation of my countenance
A psalm by David Judge me O God and pass judgment in my cause against an unholy nation Deliver me from the unjust and deceitful man
For You O God are my strength Why do You cast me off Why do I go about with a sad face when my enemy afflicts me
Send out Your light and Your truth They guided me and led me to Your holy mountain And to Your tabernacles
And I will come to the altar of God To the God who makes glad my youth I will give thanks to You with the lyre O God my God
Why are you so sad O my soul And why do you trouble me Hope in God for I will give thanks to Him My God is the salvation of my countenance
For the End a psalm for the sons of Korah for understanding OGod we heard with our ears Our fathers proclaimed it to us The work You performed in their days in days of old
Your hand utterly destroyed the nations and You planted them You afflicted and cast out peoples
For they did not inherit the land with their sword And their arm did not save them But it was Your right hand and Your arm And the light of Your countenance Because You took pleasure in them
You Yourself are my King and God Who commands salvation for Jacob
In You we shall push back our enemies And in Your name we shall scorn those who rise up against us
For I will not hope in my bow And my sword will not save me
For You saved us from those whoafflict us And You disgraced those who hate us
We shall praise God all day long And we shall give thanks to Your name forever Pause
But now You rejected and disgraced us And You will not go out with our armies
You turned us back from our enemies And those who hate us took spoil for themselves
You gave us as sheep to be eaten And You scattered us among the nations
You bound Your people without honor And there was no abundance given to ransom them
You made us a reproach to our neighbors And a scorn and derision to those around us
You made us a byword among the nations And a shaking of the head among the peoples
All day long my disgrace is before me And the shame of my face covers me
Because of the voice of him who reviles and chatters Because of the face of the enemy and persecutor
All these things came upon us but we have not forgotten You And we did not act unjustly with Your covenant
Our heart did not draw back Yet you turned our steps from Your way
You humbled us in a place of affliction And the shadow of death covered us
If we forget the name of our God And spread out our hands to a foreign god
Would not God search this out For He knows the secrets of the heart
For Your sake we are put to death all day long We are counted as sheep for the slaughter
Awake why do You sleep O Lord Arise and do not reject us to the end
Why do You turn away Your face And forget our poverty and our affliction
For our soul was humbled to the dust And our belly was joined to the ground
Arise O Lord help us And redeem us for Your names sake
1For the End concerning things that shall be changed to the sons of Korah for  understanding an ode concerning the Beloved One My heart overflowed with a good word Itell my works tothe King My tongue is the pen of a swiftwriting scribe
You are more beautiful than the sons of men Grace was poured out on Your lips Therefore God blessed You forever
Gird Your sword upon Your thigh O Mighty One In Your splendor and Your beauty
And stretch Your bow and grant prosperity and reign Because of truth gentleness and righteousness And Your right hand shall guide You wondrously
Your arrows are sharp O Mighty One The peoples shall fall under You In the heart of the Kings enemies
Your throne O God is forever and ever Your royal scepter is a scepter of uprightness
You loved righteousness and hated lawlessness Therefore God Your God anointed You With the oil of gladness more than Your companions
Myrrh and stacte and cassia pour forth from Your garments From the ivory palaces from which they gladdened You
There are daughters of kings in Your honor The queen stood at Your right hand in apparel interwoven with gold And adorned and embroidered with various colors
Listen O daughter behold and incline your ear And forget your people and your fathers house
For the King desired your beauty For He is your Lord
And the daughters of Tyre shall worship Him with gifts The rich among the people shall entreat your favor
All her glory as the Kings daughter is within Adorned and embroidered with golden tassels
The virgins behind her shall be brought to the King Her neighbors shall be brought to You
They shall be brought with gladness and rejoicing They shall be led into the temple of the King
In place of your fathers sons shall be born to you You shall make them rulers over all the earth
They shall remember your name from generation to generation Therefore peoples shall give thanks to you Forever and unto ages of ages
For the End for the sons of Korah a psalm concerning hidden things God is our refuge and power A help in afflictions that severely befall us
Therefore we will not fear when the earth is troubled And when the mountains are removed into the hearts of the seas
Their waters roared and were troubled The mountains were troubled by His might Pause
The torrents of the river gladden the city of God The Most High sanctified His tabernacle
God is in her midst she shall not be shaken God shall help her early in the morning
The nations were troubled kingdoms fell He uttered His voice the earth shook
The Lord of hosts is with us The God of Jacob is our protector Pause
Come behold the works of the Lord The wonders He wrought on the earth
When He makes wars cease tothe ends of the earth He will break the bow and shatter the weapon And He will burn up the shields in fire
Be still and know that I am God I will be exalted among the nations I will be exalted in the earth
The Lord of hosts is with us The God of Jacob is our protector
For the End a psalm for the sons of Korah Oh clap your hands all you nations Shout to God with the voice of rejoicing
For the Lord Most High is fearsome A great King over all the earth
He subdued the peoples under us And the nations under our feet
He chose us for His inheritance Jacobs beauty which He loved Pause
God ascended with a shout The Lord with the sound of the trumpet
Sing praises to God sing praises Sing praises to our King sing praises
For God is King of all the earth Sing praises with understanding
God reigns over the nations God sits on His holy throne
The rulers of the people gather together With the God of Abraham For Gods mighty ones of the earth are greatly exalted
A psalm of an ode for the sons of Korah for the second day of the week Great is the Lord and greatly to be praised In the city of our God in His holy mountain
Wellrooted in joy throughout the earth The mountains of Zion the sides of the north The city of the great King
God is known in her palaces When He helps her
For behold the kings assembled They came together
They saw her thus they marveled They were troubled they were shaken
Trembling laid hold of them There were labor pains like a woman giving birth
You shall wreck the ships of Tarshish with a violent wind
As we heard so we saw In the city of the Lord of hosts In the city of our God God established her forever Pause
We pondered Your mercy O God In the midst of Your temple
According to Your name O God So is Your praise to the ends of the earth Your right hand is full of righteousness
Let Mount Zion be glad Let the daughters of Judah greatly rejoice Because of Your judgments O Lord
Encircle Zion and embrace her Describe her towers in detail
Set your hearts on her power And observe her palaces That you may describe them to another generation
For He is God our God Forever and unto ages of ages He will shepherd us unto the ages
For the End a psalm for the sons of Korah Hear this all you nations Give ear all you inhabitants of the world
Both earthborn and the sons of men Rich and poor together
My mouth shall speak wisdom And the meditation of my heart understanding
I will incline my ear to a parable I will open my riddle on the harp
What should I fear in an evil day The lawlessness at my heel surrounds me
Those who trusted in their power And those who boast in the abundance of their wealth
A brother does not redeem shall a man redeem He will not give his ransom to God
And the price of his souls redemption
And he rested forever and shall live to the end Because he will not see decay when he sees wise men die
Foolish and senseless men die together And they leave their wealth to strangers
And their graves will be their homes continually Their dwelling places from generation to generation They called their lands after their own names
A man being in honor did not understand He was compared to the senseless cattle and became like them
Their road is a snare for them Yet afterwards men will be well pleased with their sayings
Like sheep they are put in Hades death will shepherd them And the upright shall gain dominion over them in the morning And their help shall be made old in Hades away from their glory
Yet God will redeem my soul From the hand of Hades when He shall receive me Pause
Do not be afraid when a man becomes rich And when the glory of his house is increased
For when he dies he shall carry nothing away Neither will his glory descend with him
For his soul shall be blessed in his lifetime He will acknowledge You when You do him good
He shall enter the generations of his fathers He shall not see light forever
A man being in honor did not understand He was compared to the senseless cattle and became like them
A psalm for Asaph The God of gods the Lord spoke and summoned the earth From the suns rising to its very setting
From Zion in beautys splendor God will come openly
He is our God and He shall not be silent A fire shall be kindled before Him And there shall be a mighty storm round about Him
He shall summon heaven above And the earth to judge His people
Gather His holy ones to Him Who establish His covenant upon sacrifices
And the heavens declare His righteousness For God is Judge Pause
Hear O my people and I will speak to you O Israel and I will testify against you I am God your God
I will not find fault with your sacrifices Because your whole burnt offerings are continually before Me
I will not accept a young bull from your house Nor hegoats from your flocks
For all the wild animals of the forest are Mine The cattle and the oxen in the hills
I know all the birds of heaven And the ripe fruit of the field is with Me
If I were hungry I would not tell you For the world is Mine and all its fullness
Will I eat the flesh of bulls Or drink the blood of goats
Offer to God a sacrifice of praise And pay your vows to the Most High
Call upon Me in the day of affliction And I will deliver you and you shall glorify Me Pause
To the sinner God says Why do you declare My ordinances And take up My covenant in your mouth
You hate My instruction And cast My words behind you
If you see a thief you run with him And you keep company with adulterers
Your mouth is filled with evil And your tongue weaves deceits
You sit and speak against your brother And place a stumbling block before your mothers son
You do these things and I keep silent You think I am lawless like you But I shall rebuke you and contradict you to your face
Understand these things you who forget God Lest He snatch you away and there be none to deliver
A sacrifice of praise shall glorify Me And there is the way whereby I will show him the salvation of God
For the End a psalm by David 2when Nathan the prophet came to him at the time he went in to Bathsheba Have mercy on me O God according to Your great mercy And according to the abundance of Your compassion blot out my transgression
Wash me thoroughly from my lawlessness And cleanse me from my sin
For I know my lawlessness And my sin is always before me
Against You only have I sinned And done evil in Your sight That You may be justified in Your words And overcome when You are judged
For behold I was conceived in transgressions And in sins my mother bore me
Behold You love truth You showed me the unknown and secret things of Your wisdom
You shall sprinkle me with hyssop and I will be cleansed You shall wash me and I will be made whiter than snow
You shall make me hear joy and gladness My bones that were humbled shall greatly rejoice
Turn Your face from my sins And blot out all my transgressions
Create in me a clean heart O God And renew a right spirit within me
Do not cast me away from Your presence And do not take Your Holy Spirit from me
Restore to me the joy of Your salvation And uphold me with Your guiding Spirit
I will teach transgressors Your ways And the ungodly shall turn back to You
Deliver me from bloodguiltiness O God the God of my salvation And my tongue shall greatly rejoice in Your righteousness
O Lord You shall open my lips And my mouth will declare Your praise
For if You desired sacrifice I would give it You will not be pleased with whole burnt offerings
A sacrifice to God is a broken spirit A broken and humbled heart God will not despise
Do good O Lord in Your good pleasure to Zion And let the walls of Jerusalem be built
Then You will be pleased with a sacrifice of righteousness With offerings and whole burnt offerings Then shall they offer young bulls on Your altar
For the End concerning understanding by David When Doeg the Edomite came and reported to Saul and said David went to the house of Abimelech
Why do you boast in evil O mighty man And in lawlessness all the day long
Your tongue devises wrongdoing You work deceit like a sharpened razor
You love evil rather than good Wickedness rather than speaking righteousness
You love all the words of destruction You love a deceitful tongue
Therefore God shall destroy you completely He shall pluck you up and remove you from your dwelling And uproot you from the land of the living Pause
The righteous also shall see and fear And shall laugh at him saying
Behold this man did not make God his helper But hoped in the abundance of his riches And he was made powerful in his vanity
But I am like a fruitful olive tree in the house of God I hope in Gods mercy Forever and unto ages of ages
I will give thanks to You forever for what You did And I will wait on Your name For it is good in the sight of Your holy ones
For the End for Mahaleth concerning understanding by David The fool said in his heart There is no God They are corrupt and abominable in lawlessness There is none who does good
God looked from heaven upon the sons of men To see if there were any who understood or sought God
All turned aside they were all together rendered useless There is none who does good not even one
Do all the workers of lawlessness not know They eat up my people as they eat bread and do not call upon God
They were in great fear where no fear was For God scattered the bones of menpleasers They were put to shame because God scorned them
Who will bring the salvation of Israel out of Zion When God brings back the captivity of His people Jacob will greatly rejoice and Israel will be glad
For the End in hymns concerning understanding by David 2when the Ziphites came and said to Saul Is not David hiding with us Save me O God in Your name And judge me in Your power
O God hear my prayer Give ear to the words of my mouth
For strangers rise up against me And the powerful seek after my soul They have not set God before them Pause
For behold God is my helper The Lord is the protector of my soul
He will return evils to my enemies Utterly destroy them in Your truth
I will sacrifice to You voluntarily I will give thanks to Your name O Lord for it is good
You delivered me from all my afflictions And my eye looked upon my enemies
For the End in hymns concerning understanding by David Give ear to my prayer O God And do not despise my supplication
Attend to me and hear me I am vexed in my prayer and troubled
By the enemys voice and by the sinners affliction For they turned their lawlessness upon me And in wrath they were indignant with me
My heart was troubled within me And the terror of death fell on me
Fear and trembling came upon me And the darkness covered me
I said Who will give me wings like a dove And I will fly away and be at rest
Behold I fled far away And lodged in the wilderness Pause
I wait for the One who saves me From faintheartedness and storm
Drown them in the sea O Lord and divide their tongues For I see lawlessness and strife in the city
Day and night it shall surround her upon her walls Lawlessness and trouble and wrongdoing are in her midst
And usury and treachery Have not ceased from her squares
For if an enemy reviled me I would have endured it And if one hating me boasted against me I would have hidden from him
But it was you a man my equal My guide and my friend
Who together with me sweetened our meals In Gods house we walked in unity
Let death come upon them And let them go down alive into Hades Because evils are in their dwellings in the very midst of them
But I cried out to God And the Lord heard me
Evening and morning and midday I shall tell I shall proclaim and He will hear my voice
He will redeem my soul in peace from those who draw near to me For they were with me in abundance
God shall hear and humble them He who exists before the ages Pause For there is no change in them And they have not feared God
He stretched forth His hand in punishment They defiled His covenant
They were scattered by the wrath of His face And His heart drew near His words were softened above oil And they are arrows
Cast your care upon the Lord And He shall support you He will never allow the righteous to be moved
But You O God will bring them down into the pit of decay Men of blood and deceit Shall not live even half their days But Iwill hope in You O Lord
1For the End for the people far from the holy places by David for a pillar inscription when  foreigners conquered him in Gath Have mercy on me O Lord for man tramples me down All day long he afflicts me in war
All day my enemies trample me down For many are those who war against me from on high
Iwill not fear by day But I will hope in You
I will praise God with my words all day long In God I hope I will not be afraid what will flesh do to me
All day long they make my words repulsive All their thoughts are against me for evil
They will dwell near and hide They will watch my heel As they wait for my soul
In no way will You save them In wrath You will bring down peoples O God
I declare my life to You You set my tears before You as also in Your promise
My enemies shall be turned back In whatever day I may call upon You Behold I know You are my God
In God I will praise His word In the Lord I will praise His word
In God I hope I will not be afraid What will man do to me
In me O God are vows I will render in praise to You
For You delivered my soul from death And my feet from slipping That I may be wellpleasing before God in the light of the living
1For the End corrupt not by David for a pillar inscription when he escaped from the face  of Saul to the cave Have mercy on me O God have mercy on me For my soul trusts in You And in the shadow of Your wings I will hope Until lawlessness shall pass away
I will cry out to God most High My God whois my benefactor
He sent from heaven and saved me He gave over to disgrace those who trample me down Pause God sent out His mercy and His truth
And delivered my soul from the midst of young lions Although troubled I fell asleep As for the sons of men their teeth are a weapon and arrows And their tongue is a sharp dagger
Be exalted O God above the heavens And Your glory above all the earth
They prepared a trap for my feet And they bowed down my soul They dug a pit before my face But they fell into it Pause
My heart is ready O God My heart is ready I will sing and I will sing a psalm
Awake my glory Awake harp and lyre I will arise at dawn
I will give thanks to You O Lord among the peoples I will sing to You among the Gentiles
For Your mercy is magnified to the heavens And Your truth to the clouds
Be exalted O God above the heavens And Your glory above all the earth
For the End corrupt not by David for a pillar inscription If then you truly speak of righteousness Do you judge rightly O you sons of men
For in your heart you work lawlessness in the earth Your hands weave unrighteousness
Sinners are alienated from the womb From birth they are led astray they speak lies
Their anger is according to the likeness of a serpent Like a deaf asp that stops its ears
Which will not listen to the sound of charms Nor to an enchantment of a skillful charmer
God shattered their teeth in their mouths The Lord broke the teeth of the lions
They shall pass along like water running through He will bend His bow until they are weakened
Like melting wax they will be destroyed Fire fell on them and they never saw the sun
Before your thorns are aware of its prickly shrub He will swallow you up as if you were alive as if in His anger
A righteous man shall be glad when he sees the vengeance of the ungodly He shall wash his hands in the blood of the sinner
A man will say If indeed there is fruit for the righteous man Then it is God who judges them on the earth
1For the End corrupt not by David for a pillar inscription when Saul sent and watched  his house that he might kill him Rescue me from my enemies O God And redeem me from those who rise up against me
Deliver me from the workers of lawlessness And save me from men of blood
For behold they hunt for my soul Mighty men set upon me Neither is it for my lawlessness nor for my sin O Lord
I run without lawlessness and keep a straight path Rise up and meet me and see
And You O Lord God of hosts the God of Israel Give heed and examine all the Gentiles Do not be merciful to all who work lawlessness Pause
They shall return at evening And hunger like dogs and they shall encircle the city
Behold they shall speak with their mouth And a sword is in their lips for they say Who hears
But You O Lord shall laugh at them You shall hold all the nations in contempt
O my strength I shall keep watch with You For You are my protector O God
As for my God His mercy shall go before me God will show it to me among my enemies
Do not kill them lest they forget my people Scatter them by Your power And bring them down O Lord my protector
For the sin of their mouth for the word of their lips Let them also be taken in their arrogance And from their vow of evil and lie their end will be proclaimed
In a wrath of destruction and let them be no more And they shall know God is Jacobs Lord And the Lord of the ends of the earth
They shall return at evening and hunger like dogs And they shall encircle the city
They shall be scattered to and fro so as to eat But if they are not satisfied they shall also grumble
But I will sing of Your power And greatly rejoice in Your mercy in the morning For You are my protector And my refuge in the day of my affliction
You are my helper I will sing to You For You O God are my protector You are my mercy O my God
1For the End for things yet to be changed for a pillar inscription by David for  teaching 2when he burned Mesopotamia of Syria and Syrian Soba and Joab returned and struck twelve thousand in the Valley of Salt OGod You drove us off and destroyed us You were angry and had mercy on us
You made the earth quake and You troubled it Repair its ruins for it was shaken
You showed Your people difficult things You made us drink the wine of bewilderment
You gave a sign to those who fear You So they may flee from the face of the bow Pause
That Your beloved may be rescued Save with Your right hand and hear me
God spoke in His holy place I will greatly rejoice and divide Shechem And I will measure out the valley of the tabernacles
Gilead is mine and Manasseh is mine And Ephraim is the strength of my head Judah is my king
Moab is the cauldron of my hope Over Edom I will extend my shoe Foreign tribes were subjected to me
Who will bring me into a fortified city Who will lead me as far as Edom
Will not You O God who drove us away And will not You O God go out with our armies
Give us help from affliction For the salvation of man is useless
But in God we shall work power And He will utterly scorn those who afflict us
For the End in hymns by David Hear my supplication O God Attend to my prayer
From the end of the earth I cried out to You When my heart was discouraged You lifted me high on a rock
You guided me for You became my hope A tower of strength from the face of the enemy
I will dwell in Your tabernacle unto the ages I will be covered with the shelter of Your wings Pause
For You O God hear my prayers You give an inheritance to those who fear Your name
You will add days to the days of the king His years as the days of generation to generation
He will abide before God forever Who will seek out His mercy and truth
So I will sing praise to Your name unto ages of ages That I may pay my vows day to day
For the End for Jeduthun a psalm by David Shall not my soul be submissive to God For from Him is my salvation
For He is my God and my savior My protector I shall be shaken no more
How long will you attack a man All of you murder him You attack him as you would a leaning wall and a broken hedge
They also planned to remove my honor They ran with a lie They blessed with their mouth and they cursed with their heart Pause
However be submissive to God O my soul For my patient endurance is from Him
For He is my God and my savior My protector I shall never be moved
In God is my salvation and my glory He is the God of my help and my hope is in God
Hope in Him all you congregation of people Pour out your hearts before Him God is our helper Pause
But the sons of men are useless The sons of men are liars with the yokes of wrongdoing They are altogether useless
Do not hope in wrongdoing And do not hunger for booty If riches flow in Do not set your heart on them
God spoke once I heard these two things
That power is of God and to You O Lord is mercy For You will repay every man according to his works
A psalm by David when he was in the desert of Judea OGod my God I rise early to be with You My soul thirsts for You How often my flesh thirsts for You In a desolate impassable and waterless land
So in the holy place I appear before You To see Your power and Your glory
Because Your mercy is better than life My lips shall praise You
Thus I will bless You in my life I will lift up my hands in Your name
May my soul be filled as if with marrow and fatness And my mouth shall sing praise to You with lips filled with rejoicing
If I remembered You on my bed I meditated on You at daybreak
For You are my helper And in the shelter of Your wings I will greatly rejoice
My soul follows close behind You Your right hand takes hold of me
But they seek for my soul in vain They shall go into the lowest parts of the earth
They shall be given over to the edge of the sword They shall be a portion for foxes
But the king shall be glad in God All who swear by Him shall be praised For the mouth that speaks unrighteous things is stopped
For the End a psalm by David Hear my voice O God in my supplication Deliver my soul from fear of the enemy
You sheltered me from the conspiracy of evildoers From the multitude of those who work lawlessness
Who sharpen their tongue like a sword They stretched their bow a bitter thing
To strike down the blameless man in secret Suddenly they will shoot him and not be afraid
They made an evil word strong in themselves They told of hiding snares They said Who will see them
They searched out lawlessness In searching they grew weary A man shall draw near and the heart is deep
And God shall be exalted Their blows became a childish barb
And their tongues were utterly weakened in them All who saw them were troubled
And every man was afraid And they proclaimed the works of God And understood His deeds
The righteous man shall be glad in the Lord and shall hope in Him And all the upright in heart shall be praised
1For the End a psalm by David an ode sung by Jeremiah and Ezekiel regarding the  situation of the sojourners when they were about to depart It is fitting to sing a hymn to You in Zion O God And a vow shall be rendered to You in Jerusalem
Hear my prayer To You all flesh shall come
The words of lawless men overpowered us And You will show mercy to our ungodliness
Blessed is he whom You choose and help He shall dwell in Your courts We shall be filled with the good things of Your house Holy is Your temple wondrous in righteousness
Hear us O God our savior The hope of all the ends of earth And of those far off at sea
He who prepares mountains in His strength Who is girded with power
Who troubles the depth of the sea The sounds of its waves The nations shall be troubled
And those who inhabit the ends of the earth Shall be afraid because of Your signs You shall gladden the outgoings of morning and evening
You visited the earth and watered it You enriched it abundantly The river of God is filled with waters You prepared their food for thus is Your preparation thereof
Water its furrows multiply its fruits With its raindrops the earth will be gladdened when it produces fruits
You will bless the crown of the year with Your goodness And Your fields will be filled with fatness
The desert fruits will be made fat And the hills will be girded with rejoicing
The rams of the sheep are clothed with wool And the valleys shall abound in wheat They will shout and truly sing hymns
For the End an ode of a psalm of resurrection Shout to God all the earth
Sing now to His name Give glory to His praise
Say to God How fearful are Your works In the greatness of Your power Your enemies will lie to You
Let all the earth worship You and sing to You Let them sing to Your name Pause
Come and see the works of God He is more fearful in His counsels than the sons of men
Who turns the sea into dry land They will cross over the river on foot There we will be glad in Him
In Him who as Lord shall rule in His power forever His eyes will look at the Gentiles Let not those who provoke Him be exalted in themselves Pause
Bless our God you Gentiles And make the voice of His praise to be heard
Who established my soul in life And whodid not permit my feet tobe moved
For You O God tested us You tried us in the fire as silver is purified by fire
You brought us into the snare You laid affliction on our back
You put men on our heads We went through fire and water And You led us into a refreshing place
I will go into Your house with whole burnt offerings I will pay You the vows
My lips uttered And my mouth spoke in my affliction
I will offer You whole burnt offerings full of marrow With incense and rams I will offer oxen with a young hegoat Pause
Come and hear and I will describe to you All who fear God What things He did for my soul
I cried to Him with my mouth And I exalted Him with my tongue
If I regarded wrongdoing in my heart Let not the Lord hear me
Therefore God heard me He gave heed to the voice of my supplication
Blessed be God who has not turned away my prayer Nor His mercy from me
For the End in hymns a psalm of an ode May God be gracious to us and bless us May He cause His face to shine upon us Pause
That we may know His way on the earth Your salvation among all the Gentiles
Let the peoples give thanks to You O God Let all the peoples praise You
Let the Gentiles be glad and greatly rejoice For You shall judge the peoples in uprightness And lead the Gentiles on the earth Pause
Let the peoples give thanks to You O God Let all the peoples praise You
The earth yielded her fruit May God our God bless us
May God bless us And let all the ends of the earth be in fear of Him
For the End a psalm of an ode by David Let God arise and let His enemies be scattered And let those who hate Him flee from before His face
As smoke vanishes so let them vanish As wax melts before the fire So let the sinners perish from the face of God
And let the righteous be glad Let them greatly rejoice before God Let them be glad with merriment
Sing to God sing to His name Make ready the way for Him Who rides upon the sunset His name is the Lord And greatly rejoice before Him Let them be troubled before His face
He who is the father of orphans and the judge of widows God is in His holy place
God settles the solitary in a house With courage He leads out those in bondage Likewise those who rebel who dwell in tombs
O God when You went forth before Your people When You passed through the desert Pause
The earth shook truly the heavens let the rain fall Before the face of the God of Sinai Before the face of the God of Israel
You O God willingly grant rain to Your inheritance And it was weakened but You restored it
Your creatures are dwelling in it In Your goodness O God You provide for the poor
The Lord will give His word To those proclaiming the gospel with great power
He who is the King of hosts of the beloved That He may divide the booty for the beauty of the house
If you fall asleep in the midst of your portions You will have the wings of a dove all covered with silver And her back with yellow gold Pause
When the heavenly One appoints kings over it They shall become as white as the snow on Zalmon
The mountain of God is a fertile mountain A mountain richly curdled with milk a fat mountain
Why do you think about other mountains richly curdled with milk This is the mountain God consented to dwell in Truly the Lord will lodge in it to the end
Gods chariot is ten thousandfold Thousands abounding in numbers The Lord is among them at Sinai in the holy place
You ascended on high You led captivity captive You received gifts for mankind Truly for the disobedient so they may dwell there The Lord God is blessed
Blessed is the Lord from day to day The God of our salvation will bring prosperity upon us Pause
Our God is the God who saves us And the issues of death belong to the Lords Lord
But God will crush the heads of His enemies The hairy head of those who continue in their transgressions
The Lord said I will return from Bashan I will return in the depths of the sea
So your foot may be dipped in blood The tongue of your dogs in the blood of your enemies
Your processionals were seen O God The processionals of my God and my King in the holy place
The rulers drew near singers followed after In the midst of them came young maidens playing timbrels
Bless God in the churches The Lord from the fountains of Israel
There is the young Benjamin in ecstasy The rulers of Judea are their leaders The rulers of Zebulun and Naphtali
Give command O God to Your power Strengthen O God what You accomplished in us
Because of Your temple at Jerusalem Kings will bring gifts to You
Rebuke the wild beasts of the reed The herd of bulls among the heifers of the peoples Lest they shut out those proven in silver Scatter the nations that desire wars
Ambassadors shall come out of Egypt Ethiopia shall draw near to stretch out its hand to God
Sing to God you kingdoms of the earth sing to the Lord Pause
Sing to God who rides upon the heaven of heavens towards the east Behold He will speak with His voice a voice of power
Give glory to God His magnificence is over Israel And His power is in the clouds
God is wondrous in His saints The God of Israel shall give power and strength to His people Blessed is God
For the End concerning things that shall be changed by David Save me O God for the waters flood my soul
Iam stuck in the mire of the sea and there is noplace tostand I came into the depths of the sea and the storm overwhelmed me
I grow weary with crying my throat is hoarse My eyes fail me from hoping in my God
Those who hate me without a cause multiplied even more than the hairs of my head My enemies who persecute me unjustly have become strong Then I paid for things I did not steal
O God You know my foolishness And my transgressions are not hidden from You
O Lord O Lord of hosts let not those who wait for You be put to shame because of me O God of Israel let not those who seek You feel ashamed because of me
For Your sake Ibore disgrace Humiliation covered my face
I am become a stranger to my brothers An alien to my mothers sons
For the zeal of Your house consumed me And the insults of those who disgraced You fell on me
I bent down my soul with fasting And it became a disgrace for me
I also made sackcloth my garment And I became a byword to them
Those who sit at the gate were talking against me And those who drink wine were singing about me
But I O Lord pray with my prayer to You It is the time of Your goodwill O God in the abundance of Your mercies In the truth of Your salvation hear me
Save me from the mire that I may not be stuck therein Deliver me from those who hate me and from the depths of the waters
Let not a storm of water drown me Neither let the deep swallow me up Nor the well enclose its mouth upon me
Hear me O Lord for Your mercy is good According to Your abundant compassion look upon me
Turn not Your face from Your child For I am afflicted hear me speedily
Give heed to my soul and redeem it Deliver me because of my enemies
For You know my disgrace And my shame and humiliation All who afflict me are before You
My soul expected disgrace and trouble And I waited for someone to sympathize with me but no one was there And for comforters but I found not one
They gave me gall for my food And they gave me vinegar for my drink
Let their table become a snare before them And a recompense and a stumbling block
Let their eyes be darkened so they may not see And bend down their backs continually
Pour out Your anger upon them And let the fury of Your wrath lay hold of them
Let their dwelling place be laid waste And let no one live in their tents
For they pursued closely the one You slew And they added to the pain of my wounds
Add lawlessness to their lawlessness And let them not enter into Your righteousness
Let them be blotted out from the book of the living And not be written with the righteous
I am poor and suffering And the salvation of Your presence O God lays hold of me
I will praise Gods name with a song I will magnify Him in praise
And this shall be more pleasing to God Than a young bull with horns and hooves
Let the poor behold this and be glad Seek God and your soul shall live
For the Lord hears the poor And does not despise His prisoners
Let heaven and earth praise Him The seas and everything that moves in them
For God shall save Zion And the cities of Judah shall be built And they shall dwell therein and inherit it
And the seed of His servants shall possess it And those who love His name shall dwell in it
For the End by David in remembrance 2that the Lord may save me OGod make haste to help me
May those who seek my soul be dishonored and shamed May those who plot evils against me be turned back and disgraced
May those be turned back immediately Whoshame me saying Well done Well done
May all who seek You greatly rejoice and be glad in You And let those who love Your salvation always say Let God be magnified
But I am poor and needy O God help me You are my helper and deliverer O Lord do not delay
By David of the sons of Jonadab and the first ones taken captive OGod in You I hope may I never be put to shame
Deliver me in Your righteousness and set me free Incline Your ear to me and save me
Be to me a God for protection And a strong place for salvation For You are my foundation and my refuge
O my God deliver me from the hand of the sinner From the hand of those who transgress the law and act unjustly
For You are my patience O Lord The Lord is my hope from my youth
By You I have been supported from birth From my mothers womb You have been my protector My song shall be always of You
Iam become as a wonder tomany And You are my strong helper
Let my mouth be filled with Your praise That I may sing of Your glory And of Your magnificence all the day long
Do not abandon me in the time of old age When my strength fails do not forsake me
For my enemies speak against me And those who watch for my soul plot together
Saying God forsook him Pursue and lay hold of him For there is no deliverer
O God do not stand far off from me O my God give heed to help me
Let those who falsely accuse my soul be shamed and forsaken Let those who seek evils for me be covered with shame and reproach
But I will hope continually And I will add to all Your praise
My mouth shall proclaim Your righteousness Your salvation all the day For I am not acquainted with learning
I shall enter into the power of the Lord O Lord I shall remember Your righteousness Yours alone
You taught me O God from my youth And from then until now I will proclaim Your wonders
And even to old age and to my last breath O God do not abandon me Until I proclaim Your arm to every coming generation Yes Your mighty deeds and Your righteousness
O God I proclaim the magnificent things You did Even to the highest heaven O God who is like You
How great and evil are the afflictions You showed me And You returned and made me live And You raised me up again from the depths of the earth
You multiplied Your greatness And You returned and comforted me You brought me up again from the depths of the earth
Truly I will give thanks to You with the instrument of a psalm O God I will sing to You with the lyre O Holy One of Israel
My lips will greatly rejoice when I sing to You So will my soul which You redeemed
My tongue shall meditate on Your righteousness all the day long When those who seek evils for me are dishonored and shamed
For Solomon OGod give Your judgments to the King And Your righteousness to the Kings Son
That He may judge Your people in righteousness And Your poor with judgment
Let the mountains raise up peace for Your people And the hills in righteousness
He shall judge the poor of the people And shall serve the sons of the poor He shall humble the false accuser
And He shall continue as long as the sun And before the moon from generation to generation
And He shall come down like rain on the fleece Like raindrops falling on the earth
In His days righteousness and abundance of peace shall flourish Until the moon is removed
And He shall rule from sea to sea And from the river to the ends of the inhabited earth
The Ethiopians shall bow down before Him And His enemies shall lick the dust
The kings of Tarshish and their islands will come bearing gifts The kings of Arabia and Saba will bring presents
All the kings of the earth shall worship Him All the Gentiles shall serve Him
For He rescued the poor from the hand of a strong man And the needy for whom there was no helper
He shall spare the poor and needy And He shall save the souls of the needy
He shall redeem their souls from usury and injustice And precious shall be their name in His sight
He shall live and there shall be given Him from the gold of Arabia They shall pray continually because of Him All the day long shall they bless Him
He shall be a support on the earth upon the summits of the mountains His fruit shall be exalted more than Lebanon And they shall flourish from the city like the grass of the earth
Let His name be blessed unto the ages His name shall remain before the sun And all the tribes of the earth shall be blessed in Him All the Gentiles shall bless Him
Blessed is the Lord God The God of Israel who alone does wondrous things
And blessed is the name of His glory forever and unto ages of ages And all the earth shall be filled with His glory Amen Amen
The hymns of David the son of Jesse are ended
A psalm for Asaph How good God is to Israel To the upright in heart
But as for me my feet were almost shaken My steps had nearly slipped
For I was jealous of the lawless When I beheld the peace of sinners
For there is noupward gaze at their death Nor steadfastness in their chastening
They are not in difficulties as other men And they shall not be chastened with other men
For this reason arrogance mastered them They clothed themselves with their wrongdoing and ungodliness
Their wrongdoing shall go forth as from fatness They passed through to their hearts intent
They thought and spoke in evil They spoke in wrongdoing to the height
They set their mouth against heaven And their tongue passed through the earth
For this reason my people shall return here Days of fullness shall be found in them
They said How does God know Is there knowledge in the Most High
Behold these are sinners and they prosper They possess wealth in this age
And I said Surely in vain have I kept my heart righteous And washed my hands with the innocent
For all day long I was scourged And my reproof persisted through the night
If I should speak I would describe it thus Behold I am breaking covenant with the generation of your children
And I sought to understand this It was difficult in my sight
Until I came into Gods holy place And understood their end
Surely for their deceits You appointed deceits for them You cast them down in their exaltation
Oh how they came into desolation suddenly They ceased to be they perished in their lawlessness
Like a dream to one who is awakened So O Lord You shall despise their image in Your city
For my heart was kindled And my reins were changed
And Iwas despised and did not know I became like a beast before You
And I am continually with You You hold fast my right hand
With Your counsel You guide me And with glory You take hold of me
For what is there in heaven for me but You And what do I desire on earth besides You
My heart and my flesh fail O God of my heart and God is my portion forever
For behold those whokeep themselves far away from You shall perish You destroy away from You all who act unfaithfully
But as for me it is good to cling to God To put my hope in the Lord That I may proclaim all Your praises In the gates of the daughter of Zion
Of understanding for Asaph OGod why have You rejected us to the end Why has Your anger raged against the sheep of Your pasture
Remember Your congregation You acquired from the beginning That You redeemed the rod of Your inheritance This Mount Zion where You encamped
Lift up Your hands against their arrogance to the end Against everything the enemy prostituted in Your holy places
Those who hate You boasted in the midst of Your feast They set up their signs yes signs and they did not know
As in a thicket of trees they cut down its doors with axes With battle axes and hammers they broke it down
They burned down Your sanctuary They defiled the tabernacle of Your name to the ground
Their kindred said in their heart together Come let us abolish all the feasts of God from the earth
We do not see our signs There is no longer any prophet and He will no longer know us
How long O God will the enemy reproach Will the adversary provoke Your name to the end
Why do You turn away Your hand Your right hand from the midst of Your breast to the end
But God is our King before the ages He worked salvation in the midst of the earth
You strengthened the sea by Your power You crushed the heads of dragons upon the water
You shattered the heads of the dragon You gave him as food for the Ethiopian peoples
You broke apart fountains and torrents You dried up the rivers of Etham
The day is Yours and the night is Yours You created the light and the sun
You made all the boundaries of the earth Summer and winter You formed these things
Remember this the enemy insulted the Lord And a foolish people provoked Your name
May You not deliver to wild beasts the soul who gives thanks to You May You not forget the souls of Your poor to the end
Look upon Your covenant For the dark places of the earth are filled with the houses of lawlessness
Let not the humbled and the disgraced be turned away The poor and needy shall praise Your name
Arise O God judge Your cause Remember the insults against You by the foolish man all the day long
Do not forget the voice of Your suppliants The arrogance of those who hate You rises against You continually
For the End do not corrupt a psalm of an ode for Asaph We shall give thanks to You O God We shall give thanks and call upon Your name
I shall describe all Your wonders When I seize the opportunity I shall judge these rightly
The earth is dissolved and all its inhabitants I made firm its pillars Pause
I said to those who transgress the law Do not transgress the law And to those who sin I said Do not exalt yourselves
Do not boast in yourselves Do not accuse God of wrongdoing
For judgment comes neither from the sunrise nor the sunset Nor from mountains of the deserts
For God is judge This one He brings down low and that one He raises up
For the cup in the Lords hand Is full of unmixed wine a drink poured out And He tipped it from side to side But its dregs were not emptied out All sinners of the earth shall drink them
But I shall greatly rejoice forever I shall sing to the God of Jacob
All the horns of sinners I shall crush But the horns of the righteous man shall be exalted
For the End in hymns a psalm for Asaph an ode to the Assyrian In Judah God is known His name is great in Israel
His place was made in peace And His dwelling in Zion
There He broke the power of the bows Weapon and sword and battle Pause
You give light wondrously From the everlasting mountains
All the foolish in heart were troubled All the men of wealth slept their sleep And found nothing in their hands
At Your rebuke O God of Jacob Those whomounted horses fell asleep
You are fearsome and who shall stand against You From that time on is Your wrath
You caused judgment to be heard from heaven The earth was afraid and kept quiet
When God arose for judgment To save all the gentle on the earth Pause
For a man shall give thanks to You from his heart And he shall celebrate a feast to You with his whole heart
Pray and return to the Lord Your God All around Him shall bring gifts
Tothe fearsome One and to Him whotakes away the spirits of rulers To the fearsome One among the kings of the earth
For the End concerning Idithun a psalm for Asaph With my voice I cried to the Lord With my voice to God and He gave heed to me
In the day of my affliction I sought out God With my hands before Him by night And I was not deceived My soul refused to be comforted
I remembered God and was glad I complained and my spirit became discouraged Pause
I stayed awake through all the watches of the night I was troubled and did not speak
I thought of the days of old And I remembered the eternal years and I meditated
By night I communed with my heart And my spirit searched
Will the Lord cast me off unto the ages And will He be favorable no more
Or will He cut off His mercy completely From generation to generation
Or will God forget tobe merciful Or will He in His wrath withhold His mercies Pause
I said Now I am beginning to see This change is by the right hand of the Most High
I remembered the Lords works For I will remember Your wonders of old
And I will meditate on all Your works And I will consider Your ways
O God Your way is in the holy place Who is so great a God as our God
You are the God who does wonders You made known Your power among the peoples
You redeemed Your people with Your arm The sons of Jacob and Joseph Pause
The waters saw You O God The waters saw You and were afraid And the depths were troubled A multitude like the sound of waters
The clouds uttered their voice For Your arrows passed through them
The voice of Your thunder was in the wheel Your lightning gave light to the world It was shaken and the earth was made to tremble
Your way is in the sea And Your paths are in many waters And Your footsteps shall not be known
You led Your people as sheep By the hand of Moses and Aaron
Concerning understanding for Asaph Give heed O my people to my law Incline your ear to the words of my mouth
I shall open my mouth in parables Ishall speak of hidden things from of old
What things we heard these we also knew And our fathers described them to us
It was not hidden from their children in a different generation Who declare the praises of the Lord And His mighty deeds And His wondrous things He did
He raised up a testimony in Jacob And appointed a law in Israel Whatever He commanded our fathers To make these things known to their children
That a different generation may know Children yet to be born And they will arise and declare these things to their children
So they may put their hope in God And not forget the works of God And seek out His commandments
So they may not become like their fathers A generation rebellious and embittered A generation that did not keep its heart right And its spirit was not faithful with God
The sons of Ephraim who bend and shoot their bows Turned back in the day of battle
They did not keep Gods covenant And they did not desire to walk in His law
And they forgot His good deeds And His wonders He showed them
In the sight of their fathers The marvelous things He did In the land of Egypt in the field of Zoan
He parted the sea and led them through The waters stood like a dam
And He led them with a cloud by day And all night by the light of a fire
He split the rock in the desert And gave them water to drink as in a great deep
And He brought out water from the rock And He brought it down like the waters of rivers
And they still continued to sin against Him They rebelled against the Most High in a place without water
And they tested God in their hearts By asking food for their souls
And they slandered God and said Why is God unable to prepare a table in the desert
Since He struck the rock and waters flowed And brooks flooded Is He alsounable togive us bread Or to prepare a table for His people
Therefore the Lord heard and was enraged And fire was kindled in Jacob And wrath arose against Israel
Because they did not believe in God Nor put their hope in His salvation
And He commanded the clouds above And opened the doors of heaven
And He rained manna for them to eat And gave them the bread of heaven
Man ate the bread of angels He sent them food in abundance
He took away the south wind from heaven And with His power He brought in the southwest wind
He rained flesh on them like dust And winged birds like the sand of the sea
And they fell in the midst of their camp All around their tents
And they ate and were well filled And He brought them their own desire
They were not deprived of their desire While their food was still in their mouth
The wrath of God rose up against them And killed their wealthy ones And shackled Israels chosen ones
In all these things they still sinned And did not believe in His wonders
And their days ended in folly And their years with haste
When He killed them they sought Him out And turned back and rose up early before God
They remembered God was their helper And the Most High God their redeemer
But they deceived Him with their mouth And lied to Him with their tongue
For their heart was not right with Him Neither were they faithful to His covenant
But He is merciful And will atone for their sins and not destroy them And He will multiply them and turn away His anger And He will not kindle all His wrath
For He remembered they are flesh A spirit that is passing and not returning
How many times did they rebel against Him in the desert And provoke Him to wrath in the desert
And they turned away and tempted God And provoked the Holy One of Israel
They did not remember His hand And the day He redeemed them from the hand of those afflicting them
How He wrought His signs in Egypt And His wonders in the plains of Zoan
And how He turned their rivers and rainfalls into blood So they could not drink
He sent them the dogfly and it devoured them And the frog and it destroyed them
He gave their fruit to the mildew And their labors to the locust
He killed their vineyard with hail And their mulberry trees with frost
And He delivered their cattle tothe hail And their property to the fire
He sent forth the wrath of His anger to them Anger and wrath and affliction Sent forth through evil angels
He made a path for His wrath He did not spare their souls from death And their cattle He enclosed in death
And He struck every firstborn in Egypt The firstfruit of their labor in the tents of Ham
And He brought His people out like sheep And He led them like a flock in the desert
And He guided them in hope and they were not afraid And the sea covered up their enemies
He brought them into the mountain of His holiness This mountain His right hand acquired
And He cast out the nations from before their face And distributed them a measure of land as an inheritance And He settled the tribes of Israel in their tents
They tested and rebelled against the Most High God And did not keep His testimonies
And they turned away and broke His covenant just as their fathers did And they changed into a crooked bow
And they provoked Him to anger with their high places And moved Him to jealousy with their carved images
God heard and despised them And He utterly disdained Israel
And He rejected the tabernacle at Shiloh His dwelling place where He settled among men
He gave their strength into captivity And their beauty into the hands of the enemy
And He gave His people over to the sword And despised His inheritance
Fire consumed their young men And their virgins were not lamented
Their priests fell by the sword And their widows were not lamented
Then the Lord awoke as from sleep Like a strong man drunk from wine
And He struck His enemies from behind He gave them eternal reproach
And He rejected the dwelling of Joseph And did not choose the tribe of Ephraim
He chose the tribe of Judah This Mount Zion that He loves
And He built His sanctuary as the place of unicorns He founded it forever on the earth
He chose David for His servant And took him from the sheepfolds
He took him from behind sheep that gave birth To shepherd Jacob His people And Israel His inheritance
And he shepherded them in the integrity of his heart And guided them with the skillfulness of his hands
A psalm for Asaph OGod the nations entered Your inheritance They defiled Your holy temple They left Jerusalem in ruins
They left the dead bodies of Your servants As food for the birds of heaven The flesh of Your saints for the wild animals of the earth
Their blood flowed like water around Jerusalem And there was no one to bury them
We were made a disgrace to our neighbors A scorn and a mockery to those around us
How long O Lord Will You be angry to the end Will Your jealousy burn like fire
Pour out Your wrath on the nations that do not know You And on the kingdoms that did not call upon Your name
For they devoured Jacob And made his dwelling place desolate
Do not remember our transgressions of old Let Your mercies quickly overtake us For we have become very poor
Help us O God our savior Because of the glory of Your name O Lord save us And be merciful to our sins because of Your name
Let the nations never say Where is their God And let it be known among the nations before our eyes There is vengeance for the shed blood of Your servants
Let the groaning of those in prison enter before You According to the greatness of Your arm Preserve the sons of those who were killed
Repay our neighbors sevenfold into their bosom Their reproach by which they reviled You O Lord
For we are Your people and the sheep of Your pasture We shall give thanks to You freely and openly forever From generation to generation we will proclaim Your praise
1For the End concerning things that shall be changed a testimony for Asaph a psalm  concerning the Assyrian Give heed O You who shepherd Israel Reveal Yourself O You who lead Joseph like a flock Who sit upon the cherubim
Raise up Your power Before Ephraim Benjamin and Manasseh And come for our salvation
O God convert us And reveal Your face and we shall be saved
O Lord God of hosts How long will You be angry with the prayer of Your servant
Will You feed us the bread of tears And will You give us as drink tears in measure
You made us an offense to our neighbors And our enemies sneered at us
O Lord God convert us And reveal Your face and we shall be saved Pause
You removed a vineyard from Egypt You cast out the nations and planted it
You prepared the way before it And You planted its roots and the earth was filled
Its shade covered the mountains And its vines the cedars of God
Its branches reached to the sea And its shoots as far as the river
Why did You pull down its hedge And all who pass on the road gather its grapes
A wild swine from the forest laid it waste A solitary wild beast devoured it
O God of hosts convert us now Look down from heaven and behold And visit this vineyard
Which Your right hand planted and perfect it And visit the son of man whom You strengthened for Yourself
It was set on fire and uprooted But they shall perish at the rebuke of Your face
Let Your hand be upon the man of Your right hand And upon the son of man whom You strengthened for Yourself
Then we will not turn away from You You will give us life and we will call upon Your name
O Lord God of hosts convert us and reveal Your face and we shall be saved
For the End concerning the winepresses a psalm for Asaph Rejoice in God our helper Rejoice greatly in the living God
Take up a psalm and sound a timbrel a pleasant psaltery with a harp
Sound a trumpet in the new moon On this honorable day of our feast
For this is an ordinance for Israel And a judgment by the God of Jacob
He made it a testimony in Joseph When he went out from the land of Egypt He heard a tongue he knew not
He removed his back from forced labors His hands served in the basket
You called upon Me in affliction and I delivered you I heard you in the secret place of the storm I tested you at the water of Rebellion Pause
Listen O My people for I testify to you Listen O Israel if you hear Me
There shall be no new god among you Nor shall you worship an alien god
I am the Lord your God Who brought you up from the land of Egypt Open wide your mouth and I will fill it
But My people did not hear My voice And Israel would pay no attention to Me
And I sent them away because of the desires in their hearts They shall walk in their ways of living
If My people had heard Me If Israel had walked in My ways
I would have humbled their enemies quickly And I would have laid My hand on those oppressing them
The Lords enemies lied to Him And their time shall be forever
He fed them with the finest of wheat And satisfied them with honey from the rock
A psalm for Asaph God stood in the assembly of gods He judges in the midst of gods saying
How long will you judge unjustly And favor the persons of sinners Pause
Judge an orphan and a poor man Justify a humble and poor man
Rescue a poor and needy man Deliver them from a sinners hand
They do not know nor understand They carry on in darkness All the foundations of the earth shall be shaken
I said You are gods And you are all sons of the Most High
But you die like men And like one of the rulers you fall
Arise O God judge the earth For You shall inherit all the Gentiles
An ode of a psalm for Asaph OGod who can be likened to You Be not silent nor appeased O God
For behold Your enemies made a noise And those who hate You raised up their heads
They devised a wicked judgment against Your people And they plotted against Your saints
They said Come and let us destroy them from among the people And let the name Israel be remembered no more
For they plotted together in unity They established a covenant against You
The tents of the Edomites and the Ishmaelites Moab and the Hagarenes
Gebal and Ammon and Amalek And foreigners with the inhabitants of Tyre
And even Assyria joined with them They came to the aid of the sons of Lot Pause
Deal with them as with Midian and Sisera As with Jabin at the Brook Kishon
They were destroyed at Endor They became like dung on the earth
Make their rulers like Oreb and Zeeb And all their rulers like Zebah and Zalmunna
Who said Let us inherit the holy place of God for ourselves
O my God turn them like a wheel Like straw before the face of the wind
Like fire that burns through a thicket Like a flame that sets mountains on fire
Thus You shall pursue them with Your storm And You shall trouble them in your wrath
Fill their faces with disgrace And they shall seek Your name O Lord
Let them be disgraced and troubled unto ages of ages And let them be shamed and destroyed
And let them know Your name is the Lord That You alone are Most High over all the earth
For the End concerning the winepresses a psalm for the sons of Korah How beloved are Your dwellings O Lord of hosts
My soul longs and faints for the courts of the Lord My heart and my flesh greatly rejoice in the living God
For even the sparrow found a house for herself And the turtledove a nest for herself where she will lay her young Your altars O Lord of hosts My King and my God
Blessed are those who dwell in Your house They shall praise You unto ages of ages Pause
Blessed is the man whose help is from You O Lord He purposed ascents in his heart
In the valley of weeping into the place he appointed For there the lawgiver shall give blessings
They shall go from strength to strength The God of gods shall be seen in Zion
O Lord God of hosts hear my prayer Give ear O God of Jacob Pause
O God our protector behold And look upon the face of Your anointed
For one day in Your courts is better than a thousand I chose to be an outcast in the house of my God Rather than to dwell in the tents of sinners
For the Lord God loves mercy and truth He will give grace and glory The Lords hand will not remove good things from those who walk in innocence
O Lord of hosts blessed is the man who hopes in You
For the End a psalm for the sons of Korah OLord You were pleased with Your land You turned back the captivity of Jacob
You forgave the transgressions of Your people You covered all their sins Pause
You ended all Your wrath You turned from the wrath of Your anger
Turn us O God of our salvation And turn away Your anger from us
Will You be angry with us forever Or will You prolong Your anger from generation to generation
O God You will turn and give us life And Your people will be glad in You
Show us Your mercy O Lord And grant us Your salvation
I will hear what the Lord God will speak in me For He will speak peace To His people and to His holy ones And to those who turn their heart to Him
His salvation is very close at hand to those who fear Him That glory may dwell in our land
Mercy and truth met together Righteousness and peace kissed each other
Truth arose from the earth And righteousness looked down from heaven
For the Lord will give goodness And our land shall yield its fruit
Righteousness shall go before Him And establish His footsteps as our pathway
A prayer by David Incline Your ear O Lord and hear me For I am poor and needy
Guard my soul for I am holy O my God save Your servant who hopes in You
Have mercy on me O Lord For all the day long I will cry to You
Gladden the soul of Your servant O Lord For to You O Lord I lift up my soul
For You O Lord are kind and good And very merciful to all who call upon You
Give ear O Lord to my prayer And heed the voice of my supplication
In the day of my affliction I cried to You For You heard me
There is none like You among the gods O Lord And there are no works like Your works
All the Gentiles You made shall come And worship before You O Lord And they shall glorify Your name
For You are great doing wonders You alone are the great God
Lead me in Your way O Lord And I will walk in Your truth Gladden my heart so as to fear Your name
I will give thanks to You O Lord my God with my whole heart And Ishall glorify Your name forever
For great is Your mercy to me And You rescued my soul from the lowest Hades
O God lawless men rose up against me And a gathering of strong men sought my soul And they did not set You before them
But You O Lord are compassionate and merciful Longsuffering and very merciful and truthful
Look upon me and have mercy Give Your strength to Your servant And save the son of Your handmaid
Work a sign in my midst for good And let those who hate me see it and be disgraced For You O Lord helped me and comforted me
A psalm of an ode for the sons of Korah His foundations are in the holy mountains
The Lord loves the gates of Zion More than all the dwellings of Jacob
Glorious things were said concerning you O city of God Pause
I will make mention of Rahab and Babylon to those who know Me And behold foreigners and the people of Tyre and Ethiopia These were born there
A man will say Mother Zion And a man was born in her For the Most High Himself founded it
The Lord shall describe it in a written account of the peoples And of the rulers of those who were born in her Pause
How glad are all who have their dwelling in you
1An ode of a psalm for the sons of Korah for the End for the Mahalath to respond  understanding for Heman the Israelite OLord God of my salvation Icry day and night before You
Let my prayer come before You Incline Your ear to my supplication O Lord
For my soul is filled with sorrows And my soul draws near to Hades
I am counted among those who go down into the pit I am like a helpless man free among the dead
Like slain men thrown down and sleeping in a grave Whom You remember no more But they are removed from Your hand
They laid me in the lowest pit In dark places and in the shadow of death
Your wrath rested upon me And You brought all Your billows over me Pause
You removed my acquaintances far from me They made me an abomination among themselves I was betrayed and did not go forth
My eyes weakened from poverty O Lord I cry to You the whole day long I spread out my hands to You
Will You work wonders for the dead Or will physicians raise them up and acknowledge You
Shall anyone in the grave describe Your mercy And Your truth in destruction
Shall Your wonders be known in darkness And Your righteousness in a forgotten land
But I cry to You O Lord And in the morning my prayer shall come near to You
Why O Lord do You reject my soul And turn away Your face from me
I am poor and in troubles from my youth But having been exalted I was humbled and brought into despair
Your fierce anger passed over me And Your terrors greatly troubled me
They compassed me like water all the day long They surrounded me at once
You removed far from me neighbor and friend And my acquaintances because of my misery
Concerning understanding for Ethan the Israelite OLord I will sing of Your mercies forever I will proclaim Your truth with my mouth from generation to generation
For You said Mercy shall be built up forever Your truth shall be prepared in the heavens
I made a covenant with My chosen ones I swore to David My servant
I shall prepare your seed forever And I shall build your throne from generation to generation Pause
The heavens shall confess Your wonders O Lord And Your truth in the church of the saints
For who in the clouds shall be compared to the Lord And who among the sons of God shall be compared to the Lord
God is glorified in the counsel of saints He is great and fearful toward all round about Him
O Lord God of hosts who is like You You are powerful O Lord and Your truth is around You
You are master of the seas strength And You calm the surging of its waves
You humbled the arrogant man as though he were wounded And with the arm of Your power You scattered Your enemies
The heavens belong to You and the earth is Yours You founded the world and all its fullness
You created the north wind and the seas Tabor and Hermon shall greatly rejoice in Your name
Your arm rules with power Let Your hand be strengthened let Your right hand be exalted
The foundation of Your throne is righteousness and judgment Mercy and truth shall go before Your face
Blessed are the people whoknow glad shouting O Lord they shall walk in the light of Your face
And shall greatly rejoice in Your name the whole day long And they shall be exalted in Your righteousness
For You are the boast of their power And in Your good pleasure our horn shall be exalted
For our defense is from the Lord And from the Holy One of Israel our King
Then You spoke to Your holy ones in a vision And You said I established help for a mighty one I raised up a chosen one from My people
I found David My servant I anointed him with My holy oil
For My hand shall support him And My arm shall strengthen him
The enemy shall have no advantage against him And the son of lawlessness shall not continue doing evil to him
I will cut his enemies to pieces before his face And I shall put to flight those who hate him
My truth and My mercy are with him And in My name shall his horn be exalted
I will put his hand in the sea And his right hand in the rivers
He shall call upon Me saying You are my Father My God and the protector of my salvation
I shall make him my firstborn Higher than the kings of the earth
I shall keep My mercy for him forever And My covenant shall be trustworthy with him
I shall establish his seed unto ages of ages And his throne as the days of heaven
If his sons forsake My law And do not walk in My judgments
If they profane My ordinances And donot keep My commandments
I shall visit their transgressions with a rod And their sins with a whip
But I will not turn away My mercy from him Nor will I act unjustly with My truth
Nor will I profane My covenant And I will not reject the things that proceeded from My lips
Once for all I swore in My holy place That I would not lie to David
His seed shall remain forever And his throne as the sun before Me
And as the moon that is established forever And is a faithful witness in heaven Pause
But You pushed him away and scorned him You rejected Your anointed
You overturned the covenant of Your servant You profaned his sanctuary to the ground
You pulled down all his walls You put cowardice in his stronghold
All who traveled through there robbed him He was a disgrace to his neighbors
You exalted the right hand of his enemies You delighted all his adversaries
You turned away Your help from his sword And did not support him in his war
You deprived him of purification You broke his throne to pieces on the ground
You shortened the days of his time You poured down shame upon him Pause
How long O Lord will You turn away to the end Will Your wrath always burn like fire
Let my substance be remembered as to what sort it is For did You create all the sons of men in vain
What kind of man is there who will live and not see death Will he deliver his soul from the hand of Hades Pause
Where O Lord are Your mercies of old Which in Your truth You swore to David
Remember O Lord the reproach of Your servants I bore in my bosom The reproach of many nations
Wherewith Your enemies scorned O Lord Wherewith they scorned the change of Your anointed
Blessed is the Lord forever Amen Amen
A prayer of Moses a man of God OLord You became a refuge to us in generation and generation
Before the mountains were made And before the earth and the world were formed And from everlasting to everlasting You are
Do not let man be turned back to humiliation And You said Return you sons of men
For a thousand years in Your sight Are like yesterday which passed And like a watch in the night
Years shall be objects of contempt to them In the morning let man pass by like grass
In the morning let him blossom and pass by In the evening let him fall off be dried up and withered
For we fainted in Your wrath And in Your wrath we were troubled
You set our transgressions before You Our time in the light of Your face
For all our days failed And in Your wrath we fainted Our years were spent in thought like a spider
As for the days of our years their span is seventy years But if we stay strong perhaps eighty And most of them are labor and pain For meekness came upon us and we shall be chastened
Who knows the power of Your wrath And who knows Your anger because of Your fear
So make known Your right hand to us that we may number our days And our heart may be bound with wisdom
Return O Lord how long And be entreated concerning Your servants
We were filled with Your mercy in the morning And in all our days we greatly rejoiced and were glad
Gladden us in return for the days You humbled us For the years we saw evil things
And behold Your servants and Your works And guide their sons
And let the brightness of the Lord our God be upon us And prosper for us the works of our hands
The praise of an ode by David He who dwells in the help of the Most High Shall lodge in the shelter of the God of heaven
He shall say to the Lord You are my protector and my refuge My God I will hope in Him
For He shall free me from the snare of the hunters And from every troubling word
He shall overshadow you with His shoulders And under His wings you shall hope His truth shall encircle you with a shield
You shall not be frightened by fear at night Nor from an arrow that flies by day
Nor by a thing moving in darkness Nor by mishap and a demon of noonday
A thousand shall fall at your side And ten thousand at your right hand Yet it shall not come near you
But you shall observe with your eyes And you shall see the reward of sinners
For You O Lord are my hope You made the Most High your refuge
Evils shall not come to you And a scourge shall not draw near your dwelling
For He shall command His angels concerning you To keep you in all your ways
In their hands they shall bear you up Lest you strike your foot against a stone
You shall tread upon the asp and the basilisk And you shall trample the lion and the dragon
For he hoped in Me and I will deliver him I will shelter him because he knew My name
He shall call upon Me and I will hear him I am with him in affliction And I will deliver and glorify him
With length of days I will satisfy him And show him My salvation
A psalm of an ode for the Sabbath day It is good to give thanks to the Lord And tosing to Your name O Most High
To proclaim Your mercy in the morning And Your truth at night
On the harp of ten strings with an ode on the lyre
For You make me glad O Lord with Your work And I will greatly rejoice in the works of Your hands
How magnificent are Your works O Lord Your thoughts are exceedingly deep
A man without discernment shall not know these things And a senseless man shall not understand them
When sinners grow like grass And all the workers of lawlessness have arrogant looks It is so that they may be destroyed unto ages of ages
But You O Lord are Most High forever
For behold Your enemies shall perish And all who work lawlessness shall be scattered abroad
And my horn shall be exalted like the unicorn And my old age shall be blessed with rich mercy
My eye looked upon my enemies And my ear shall hear of evildoers who rise up against me
The righteous shall flourish like a palm tree He shall be multiplied like the cedar in Lebanon
Those planted in the house of the Lord Shall blossom forth in the courts of our God
They shall still be increased in a rich old age And shall be prospering
So as to proclaim The Lord my God is upright And there is no wrongdoing in Him
1For the day before the Sabbath when the earth was settled the praise of an ode by  David The Lord reigns He clothed Himself with majesty The Lord clothed and girded Himself with power And He established the world which shall not be moved
Your throne is prepared from of old You are from everlasting
The rivers O Lord lift up The rivers lift up their voices
Because of the voices of their many waters Marvelous are the billows of the sea Wondrous is the Lord on high
Your testimonies are very much believed Holiness is proper to Your house O Lord Unto length of days
A psalm by David for the fourth day of the week The Lord is the God of vengeance The God of vengeance declares Himself boldly
Be exalted O You who judge the earth Render the arrogant their reward
How long will sinners O Lord How long will sinners boast
How long will they utter and speak wrongdoing How long will all who work lawlessness speak
They humbled Your people O Lord And they maltreated Your inheritance
They killed the widow and the resident alien And they murdered the orphans
And said The Lord will not see Nor will the God of Jacob understand
Now understand all you without discernment among the people And all you fools at length be discerning
He who planted the ear shall He not hear Or He who formed the eye shall He not see
He who chastises the nations shall He not reprove them He who teaches man knowledge
The Lord knows the thoughts of men are vain
Blessed is the man whom You instruct O Lord And whom You teach from Your law
So You may give him rest from evil days Until a pit is dug for the sinner
For the Lord will not reject His people And He will not forsake His inheritance
Until righteousness returns to judgment And all the upright in heart possess it Pause
Who will rise up for me against evildoers Or who will side with me against the workers of lawlessness
If the Lord had not helped me My soul would have almost sojourned in Hades
If I said My foot slipped Your mercy O Lord helped me
O Lord according to the abundance of grief in my heart Your encouragements consoled my soul
Shall a throne of lawlessness be present with You A throne that frames trouble by an ordinance
They shall hunt for the soul of a righteous man And shall condemn innocent blood
And the Lord has become a place of refuge for me And my God the helper of my hope
And repay their lawlessness to them And according to their wickedness The Lord our God shall destroy them
The praise of an ode by David Come let us greatly rejoice in the Lord Let us shout aloud to God our savior
Let us come before His face with thanksgiving And let us shout aloud to Him with psalms
For the Lord is a great God A great King over all the gods
For in His hand are the ends of the earth And the heights of the mountains are His
For the sea is His and He made it And His hands formed the dry land
Come let us worship and fall down before Him And let us weep before the Lord who made us
For He is our God And we are the people of His pasture And the sheep of His hand Today if you hear His voice
Donot harden your hearts as in the Rebellion During the day of testing in the desert
Where your fathers tempted Me They tested Me and saw My works
For forty years I was treated with contempt by that generation And I said They always go astray in their heart And they do not know My ways
So I swore in My wrath They shall not enter My rest
When the house was built after the captivity an ode by David Oh sing a new song to the Lord Sing to the Lord all the earth
Sing to the Lord bless His name Proclaim His salvation from day to day
Declare His glory among the Gentiles His wonders among all peoples
For the Lord is great and is greatly to be praised And He is to be feared above all the gods
For all the gods of the nations are demons But the Lord made the heavens
Thanksgiving and beauty are before Him Holiness and majesty are in His holy place
Bring to the Lord O families of the Gentiles Bring to the Lord glory and honor
Bring to the Lord the glory of His name Take up sacrifices and enter into His courts
Worship the Lord in His holy court Let all the earth be shaken before Him
Say among the Gentiles The Lord is King For He established the world which shall not be shaken He shall judge the peoples with uprightness
Let the heavens be glad and let the earth greatly rejoice Let the sea be shaken and all its fullness
Then the fields and everything in them shall rejoice Then all the trees of the forest shall greatly rejoice
Before the face of the Lord for He is coming For He is coming to judge the earth He shall judge the world in righteousness And the peoples with His truth
By David when His earth is restored The Lord reigns let the earth greatly rejoice Let the many islands be glad
Clouds and darkness surround Him Righteousness and judgment are the right ordering of His throne
Fire shall go out before Him And burn up His enemies on every side
His lightning gave light to the world The earth saw and was shaken
The mountains melted like wax at the presence of the Lord At the presence of the Lord of all the earth
The heavens proclaimed His righteousness All the peoples saw His glory
Let all who worship the carved images be shamed All whoboast in their idols Worship Him all you His angels
Zion heard and was glad And the daughters of Judah greatly rejoiced Because of Your judgments O Lord
For You are the Lord Most High over all the earth Exalted exceedingly over all the gods
You who love the Lord hate evil The Lord keeps the souls of His saints He shall deliver them from the hand of sinners
Light dawned for the righteous And gladness for the upright in heart
Be glad in the Lord O righteous ones And give thanks at the remembrance of His holiness
A psalm by David Sing a new song to the Lord For He did wondrous things His right hand and His holy arm Saved peoples for Him
The Lord made known His salvation He revealed His righteousness in the sight of the Gentiles
He remembered His mercy to Jacob And His truth to the house of Israel All the ends of the earth saw the salvation of our God
Shout aloud to God all the earth Sing and greatly rejoice and sing psalms
Sing to the Lord on a lyre On a lyre and with the voice of a psalm
With trumpets of metal and the sound of a trumpet of horn Shout aloud before the Lord our King
Let the sea be shaken and its fullness The world and those who dwell in it
The rivers shall clap their hands together The mountains shall greatly rejoice
For He comes to judge the earth He shall judge the world in righteousness And the peoples with uprightness
A psalm by David The Lord reigns let the peoples be angry The Lord sits upon the cherubim let the earth be shaken
The Lord is great in Zion And He is exalted above all the peoples
Let them give thanks to Your great name For it is fearful and holy
The Kings honor loves judgment You prepare uprightness You work judgment and righteousness in Jacob
Exalt the Lord our God And worship at the footstool of His feet For He is holy
Moses and Aaron are among His priests And Samuel is among those who call upon His name They called upon the Lord and He heard them
He spoke to them in a pillar of cloud They kept His testimonies And the ordinances He gave them
O Lord our God You listened to them O God You were very merciful to them While avenging all their ways of living
Exalt the Lord our God And worship at His holy mountain For the Lord our God is holy
A psalm of thanksgiving Shout aloud to the Lord all the earth
Serve the Lord with gladness Come before Him with great joy
Know this the Lord He is God He made us and not we ourselves We are His people and the sheep of His pasture
Enter into His gates with thanksgiving And into His courts with hymns Give thanks to Him praise His name
For the Lord is good His mercy is everlasting And His truth is from generation togeneration
A psalm by David OLord I will sing to You of mercy and judgment
I will sing and understand in a blameless way When will You come to me I walked in the innocence of my heart in the midst of my house
I have not set any lawless thing before my eyes I hated those who commit transgressions
A crooked heart shall not cleave to me As for the evil man who turned away from me I did not know him
He who secretly slanders his neighbor This one I chased away The one with an arrogant eye and insatiable heart With this one I did not eat
My eyes were on the faithful of the earth so they might dwell with me He who walks in a blameless way this one ministered to me
He who acts arrogantly did not dwell in the midst of my house He who speaks unjustly did not prosper before my eyes
In the morning I slew all the sinners of the earth So as to destroy from the city of the Lord all the workers of lawlessness
1A prayer by a poor man when he was depressed and poured out his supplication before the  Lord Hear my prayer O Lord And let my cry come to You
Do not turn Your face from me In the day when I am afflicted incline Your ear to me In the day when I call upon You hear me quickly
For my days vanished like smoke And my bones burned up like firewood
Iwas cut down like grass and my heart became withered For I forgot to eat my bread
Because of the sound of my groaning My bones cleaved to my flesh
I have become like a pelican in a desert I have become like an owl in a ruined house
I kept watch and have become Like a sparrow alone on a housetop
My enemies reproached me all day long And those who praised me swore against me
For I ate ashes like bread And mixed my drink with weeping
Because of the wrath of Your countenance and Your anger For You lifted me up and broke me down
My days were far spent like a shadow And I am withered like grass
But You O Lord remain forever And Your remembrance is from generation to generation
When You rise up You shall have compassion on Zion For it is time to have compassion on her because the time is come
For Your servants took pleasure in her stones And they shall have compassion for her dust
And the Gentiles shall fear the name of the Lord And all the kings of the earth Your glory
For the Lord shall build Zion And He shall be seen in His glory
He regarded the prayer of the humble And He did not despise their supplication
Let this be written for another generation And the people who are created shall praise the Lord
For He looked down from the height of His holy place The Lord looked upon the earth from heaven
To hear the groaning of those bound To set free the sons of the slain
To declare the Lords name in Zion And His praise in Jerusalem
When the peoples and the kingdoms Are gathered together to serve the Lord
He replied to Him in the way of strength Declare to me the fewness of my days
Take me not away in the midst of my days Your years are throughout all generations
In the beginning O Lord You founded the earth And the heavens are the works of Your hands
They shall perish but You shall remain And all things shall grow old like a garment And like a cloak You shall change them And they shall be changed
But You are the same and Your years shall not fail
The children of Your servants shall dwell there And their seed shall be led to prosperity forever
By David Bless the Lord O my soul And everything within me bless His holy name
Bless the Lord O my soul And forget not all His rewards
Whois merciful toall your transgressions Who heals all your diseases
Who redeems your life from corruption Who crowns you with mercy and compassion
Who satisfies your desire with good things And your youth is renewed like the eagles
The Lord shows mercies And judgment to all who are wronged
He made known His ways to Moses The things He willed to the sons of Israel
The Lord is compassionate and merciful Slow toanger and abounding in mercy
He will not become angry to the end Nor will He be wrathful forever
He did not deal with us according to our sins Nor reward us according to our transgressions
For according to the height of heaven from earth So the Lord reigns in mercy over those who fear Him
As far as the east is from the west So He removes our transgressions from us
As a father has compassion on his children So the Lord has compassion on those who fear Him
For He knows how He formed us He remembers we are dust
As for man his days are like grass As a flower of the field so he flourishes
For the wind passes through it and it shall not remain And it shall no longer know its place
But the mercy of the Lord is from age to age upon those who fear Him And His righteousness upon childrens children
To such as keep His covenant And remember His commandments to do them
The Lord prepared His throne in heaven And His Kingdom rules over all
Bless the Lord all you His angels Mighty in strength who do His word Soas tohear the voice of His words
Bless the Lord all you His hosts His ministers who do His will
Bless the Lord all His works In all places of His dominion Bless the Lord O my soul
By David Bless the Lord O my soul O Lord my God You are magnified exceedingly You clothe Yourself with thanksgiving and majesty
Who cover Yourself with light as with a garment Who stretch out the heavens like a curtain
You are He who covers His upper chambers with waters Who makes the clouds His means of approach Who walks on the wings of the winds
Who makes His angels spirits And His ministers a flame of fire
He established the earth on its stable foundation It shall not be moved unto ages of ages
The deep like a garment is His covering The waters shall stand upon the mountains
At Your rebuke they shall flee At the sound of Your thunder they shall be afraid
The mountains rise up and the plains sink down To the place You founded for them
You set a boundary they shall not pass over Neither shall they return to cover the earth
You are He who sends springs into the valley The waters shall pass between the mountains
They shall give drink to all the wild animals of the field The wild asses shall quench their thirst
The birds of heaven shall dwell beside them They shall sing from the midst of the rocks
You are He who waters the mountains from His higher places The earth shall be satisfied with the fruit of Your works
You are He who causes grass to grow for the cattle And the green plant for the service of man To bring forth bread from the earth
And wine gladdens the heart of man To brighten his face with oil And bread strengthens mans heart
The trees of the plain shall be full of fruit The cedars of Lebanon which You planted
There the sparrows shall make their nests The house of the heron takes the lead among them
The high mountains are for the deer The cliff is a refuge for the rabbits
He made the moon for seasons The sun knows its setting
You established darkness and it was night Wherein all the wild animals of the forest will prowl about
The young lions roar and snatch their prey And seek their food from God
The sun arises and they are gathered together And they shall be put to bed in their dens
Man shall go out to his work And to his labor until evening
O Lord Your works shall be magnified greatly You made all things in wisdom The earth was filled with Your creation
There is this great and spacious sea The creeping things are there without number The living things are there both small and great
There the ships pass through There is this dragon You formed to play therein
All things wait upon You That You may give them food in due season
When You give it tothem they shall gather it When You open Your hand all things shall be filled with Your goodness
But when You turn Your face away they shall be troubled When You take away their breath they shall die And return again to their dust
You shall send forth Your Spirit and they shall be created And You shall renew the face of the earth
Let the glory of the Lord be forever The Lord shall be glad in His works
He looks upon the earth and makes it tremble He touches the mountains and they smoke
I will sing to the Lord all my life I will sing to my God as long as I exist
May my words be pleasing to Him And I shall be glad in the Lord
May sinners cease from the earth And the lawless so as to be no more Bless the Lord O my soul
Alleluia Give thanks to the Lord and call upon His name Report His works among the Gentiles
Sing to Him and play a stringed instrument to Him Describe all His wonderful works
Praise His holy name Let the heart of those who seek the Lord be glad
Seek the Lord and be strengthened Seek His face continually
Remember the wonders He performed Of His marvels and the judgments of His mouth
O seed of Abraham His servants O sons of Jacob His chosen ones
He is the Lord our God His judgments are in all the earth
Remember His covenant forever And His word He commanded for a thousand generations
Which He established with Abraham And His oath with Isaac
And He established it as an ordinance with Jacob And as an everlasting covenant with Israel
Saying I shall give you the land of Canaan As the portion of your inheritance
When they were few in number The smallest and sojourners in the land
And passed through from nation to nation From a kingdom to a different people
He allowed no man to wrong them And He reproved kings on their behalf
Do not touch My anointed ones And do not act wickedly towards My prophets
And He called a famine upon the land He shattered all their provision of bread
He sent a man before them He sold Joseph into slavery
They humbled his feet with fetters His soul passed into the iron
Until his word came to pass The revelation of the Lord tried him in the fire
The king the ruler of the people sent and released him And he acquitted him
He made him lord of his house And ruler of all his domain
To instruct his rulers as himself And to teach his elders wisdom
And Israel came into Egypt And Jacob sojourned in the land of Ham
He increased His people greatly And made them stronger than their enemies
He changed their heart tohate His people To deal craftily with His servants
He sent Moses His servant He sent Aaron whom He chose
He put among them the words of His signs And of His wonders in the land of Ham
He sent darkness and it grew dark And they rebelled against His words
He turned their waters into blood And He killed their fish
Their land produced frogs In the chambers of their kings
He spoke and the dogfly came And gnats in all their borders
He gave them hail for rain Fire burned up their land
And He smote their vineyards and their fig trees And He shattered every tree in their domain
He spoke and the locust came And the caterpillar without number
And ate up all the grass in their land And devoured the fruit of their land
And He smote all the firstborn in their land The firstling of all their labor
He led them out with silver and gold And there was not among their tribes one who was feeble
Egypt was gladdened by their exodus For fear of them fell upon them
He spread a cloud as a cover for them And a fire to give them light at night
They asked and the quails came And He filled them with the bread of heaven
He split the rock and the waters flowed The rivers ran in the waterless places
For He remembered His holy word Which He gave to His servant Abraham
He brought out His people with exceeding joy And His chosen ones with gladness
And He gave them the lands of the nations And they inherited the labors of the peoples
So they might keep His ordinances And seek out His law
1Alleluia Give thanks to the Lord for He is good For His mercy endures forever
Who shall tell the mighty deeds of the Lord Who shall make all His praises heard
Blessed are those who keep His judgment And do righteousness at all times
Remember us O Lord because of the goodwill of Your people Visit us with Your salvation
So as to see it in the goodness of Your chosen ones So as to be glad with the joy of Your nation So as to praise You in the midst of Your inheritance
We sinned with our fathers We committed lawlessness we acted wrongfully
Our fathers did not understand Your wonders in Egypt They did not remember the multitude of Your mercy But rebelled when they went up to the Red Sea
But He saved them because of His name So they might know His power
And He rebuked the Red Sea and it was dried up And He led them in the sea as though it were a desert
He saved them from the hands of those who hated them And redeemed them from the hand of the enemy
So the water covered those who afflicted them There was not one left among them
Then they believed His words And sang His praise
They were quick to forget His works They did not wait for His counsel
And they desired exceedingly in the desert And tempted God in a waterless place
So He gave them their request And fully satisfied their souls
They also angered Moses in the camp And Aaron the holy one of the Lord
The earth was opened and swallowed Dathan And buried the assembly of Abiram
A fire kindled in their assembly The flame burned up the sinners
They made a calf in Horeb And bowed down and worshiped the graven image
Thus they changed their glory Into the likeness of a calf that eats grass
They forgot the God who saved them Who did great things in Egypt
And marvelous things in the land of Ham Fearful things at the Red Sea
And He said He would destroy them Had not Moses His chosen one Stood among them in the destruction before Him To turn away His wrath so as not to destroy them
Then they despised the desired land They did not believe His word
But murmured in their tents They did not listen to the Lords voice
So He raised His hand against them To overthrow them in the desert
And to overthrow their seed among the nations And to scatter them among the countries
They were consecrated to BaalPeor And ate sacrifices of the dead
So they provoked Him with their ways of living And destruction multiplied among them
Then Phinehas stood among them and made atonement And the destruction ceased
And it was reckoned as righteousness to him From generation to generation forever
They also provoked Him to anger at the water of Rebellion And Moses was afflicted because of them
For they embittered his spirit And he spoke offensively with his lips
They did not destroy the nations the Lord said to destroy
But mingled with the nations And learned their works
And they served their graven images And this became a snare for them
They also sacrificed their sons And their daughters to demons
And shed innocent blood The blood of their sons and daughters Whom they sacrificed to the graven images of Canaan So the land was polluted with their blood
It was also defiled by their works Thus they acted unfaithfully in their ways of living
And the Lord was very angry with His people And He abhorred His inheritance
Then He delivered them into the hands of the nations And those who hated them ruled over them
Their enemies also afflicted them And they were humbled under their hands
He delivered them many times But they rebelled against Him with their counsel And were humbled by their transgressions
And He saw them in their afflictions He listened to their supplications
And He remembered His covenant And felt regret according to the multitude of His mercy
So He aroused compassion for them Among all who made them captives
Save us O Lord our God And gather us from the nations So we may give thanks to Your holy name And boast in Your praise
Bless the Lord God of Israel from everlasting to everlasting And all the people shall say Amen Amen
1Alleluia Give thanks to the Lord for He is good For His mercy endures forever
Let those redeemed by the Lord say so Whom He redeemed from the hand of the enemy
He gathered them from the countries From the east and the west and the north and the south
They were led astray in the desert in a place without water They did not find a road to an inhabited city
While hungering and thirsting Their soul fainted in them
And they cried out to the Lord in their affliction And He delivered them from their distresses
And He led them in a straight path So they might go to a city of habitation
Let them give thanks to the Lord for His mercies And His wonders to the sons of men
For He fed the empty soul And filled the hungry soul with good things
Those sitting in the darkness and shadow of death Bound in poverty and fetters
For they rebelled against the teachings of God And provoked the counsel of the Most High
Thus their heart was humbled by troubles They were weak and there was no one to help them
Then they cried out to the Lord in their afflictions And He saved them from their distresses
And He brought them out of darkness and the shadow of death And broke their chains to pieces
Let them give thanks to the Lord for His mercies His wonders to the sons of men
For He crushed the gates of bronze And shattered the bars of iron
He helped them out of their lawless ways For they were humbled because of their transgressions
Their soul abhorred all manner of food And they drew near the gates of death
Then they cried to the Lord in their afflictions And He saved them from their distresses
He sent His Word and healed them And delivered them from their corruptions
Let them give thanks to the Lord for His mercies And His wonders to the sons of men
And let them offer a sacrifice of praise And let them proclaim His works with exceeding joy
Those who go down to the sea in ships Who do business in many waters
These see the works of the Lord And His wonders in the deep
He spoke and a stormy wind arose And its waves were lifted up
They mount up to the heavens And descend into the deep Their soul is consumed with evils
They were troubled they were shaken like one drunk with wine And all their wisdom was consumed
Then they cried to the Lord in their affliction And He brought them out of their distresses
He also commanded the storm and it became a breeze And its waves were still
Then they were glad for they were silent And He guided them to the haven of their desire
Let them give thanks to the Lord for His mercies And His wonders to the sons of men
Let them exalt Him in the assembly of the people And praise Him in the seat of the elders
He turned rivers into a desert And streams of water intodry ground
A fruitful land into salt water Because of the evils of those living there
He turned the desert into pools of water And a land without water into streams of water
Then He caused the hungry to dwell there And established a city for habitation
They sowed fields and planted vineyards And produced much fruit
So He blessed them and they were multiplied exceedingly And their cattle did not diminish
But they were diminished and maltreated By the affliction of evils and pain
Contempt was poured out on princes And He made them wander in an impassible place where there was no road
Yet He helped the poor man out of his poverty And made his families like a flock
The righteous shall see this and be glad And all lawlessness shall stop its mouth
Who is wise and shall keep these things And shall understand the mercies of the Lord
The ode of a psalm by David My heart is ready O God my heart is ready I will sing and give praise in my glory
Awaken lute and harp I shall awaken early in the morning
I will give thanks to You among the peoples O Lord And I will sing to You among the Gentiles
For great is Your mercy above the heavens And Your truth even to the clouds
Be exalted above the heavens O God And Your glory above all the earth
That Your beloved ones may be delivered Save with Your right hand and hear me
God spoke in His place I shall be exalted and I will divide Shechem And measure out the valley of tents
Gilead is Mine and Manasseh is Mine And Ephraim is the strength of My head Judah is My king
Moab is the cauldron of My hope I will stretch out My shoe over Edom Foreign tribes were subjected to Me
Who will bring me into a fortified city Who will lead me as far as Edom
Will not You O God who drove us away And will You not go out with our armies O God
Give us help from affliction For the salvation of man is worthless
In God we shall do a mighty thing And He shall despise our enemies
For the End a psalm by David OGod do not pass over my praise in silence
For the mouth of the sinner and the mouth of the deceitful man opened against me They spoke against me with a deceitful tongue
And they surrounded me with words of hatred And warred against me without cause
Instead of loving me they falsely accused me But I continued to pray
So they repaid me evil for good And hatred for my love
Set a sinner over him And let the devil stand at his right hand
And when he is judged may he go forth condemned And let his prayer become sin
Let his days be very few And may a different man receive his office
Let his children be fatherless And his wife a widow
Let his children wander about and be beggars Let them be cast out of their houses
Let the creditor search out whatever possessions he has Let strangers plunder his labors
Let there be no helper for him Nor a compassionate one for his fatherless children
Let his children be utterly destroyed In a single generation let his name be blotted out
May the lawlessness of his fathers be remembered before the Lord And may the sin of his mother not be blotted out
Let them be continually before the Lord And may the remembrance of them be utterly destroyed from the earth
Because he did not remember to show mercy But persecuted a poor and needy man And one pierced to the heart that he might kill him
And he loved cursing and it came to him And he did not desire blessing so it shall be far from him
So he clothed himself with cursing like a garment And it entered like water into his bowels And like oil into his bones
Let it be for him like a garment that clothes him And like a belt that girds him continually
This is the work of those who falsely accuse me before the Lord And of those who speak evil things against my soul
But You O Lord O Lord deal mercifully with me for Your names sake For Your mercy is good
Save me for I am poor and needy And my heart is troubled within me
I was removed like a shadow when it declines I was shaken off like the locusts
My knees were weak from fasting And my flesh was changed because of the oil
And I became an object of reproach to them They saw me they shook their heads
Help me O Lord my God Save me according to Your mercy
Then let them know this is Your hand And You O Lord did this
They themselves shall curse but You shall bless Let those who rise up against me be put to shame But let Your servant be glad
Let those who falsely accuse me be clothed with shame And let them be covered with their dishonor like a double cloak
I will give thanks to the Lord abundantly with my mouth And in the midst of many I will praise Him
Because He stood at the right hand of a poor man To save me from those who persecute my soul
A psalm by David The Lord said to my Lord Sit at My right hand Until I make Your enemies the footstool of Your feet
The Lord shall send forth the rod of Your power from Zion And rule in the midst of Your enemies
With You is the beginning in the day of Your power In the brightness of Your saints I have begotten You from the womb before the morning star
The Lord swore and will not repent You are a priest forever according to the order of Melchizedek
The Lord at Your right hand crushed kings in the day of His wrath
He shall judge among the nations He shall fill them with dead bodies He shall crush the heads of many on earth
He shall drink from the brook on the way Therefore He shall raise His head high
Alleluia Iwill give thanks to You O Lord with my whole heart In the council of the upright and in the assembly
Great are the works of the Lord Sought out in all things with regard to His will
Thanksgiving and majesty are His work And His righteousness continues unto ages of ages
He made a remembrance of His wonders The Lord is merciful and compassionate
He gave food to those who fear Him He shall remember His covenant forever
He declared the strength of His works to His people So as to give them the inheritance of the nations
The works of His hands are truth and judgment Faithful are all His commandments
Established unto ages of ages Made in truth and uprightness
He sent redemption to His people He commanded His covenant forever Holy and fearful is His name
The beginning of wisdom is the fear of the Lord A good understanding is in all whopractice it His praise continues unto ages of ages
Alleluia Blessed is the man who fears the Lord He will delight exceedingly in His commandments
His seed shall be mighty on earth The generation of the upright shall be blessed
Glory and riches shall be in his house And his righteousness continues unto ages of ages
For the upright light springs up in darkness For he is merciful compassionate and righteous
A good man is compassionate and lends He will manage his words with judgment
For he shall be unshaken forever A righteous man shall be in everlasting remembrance
He shall not be afraid because of an evil report His heart is prepared to hope in the Lord
His heart is established he is not afraid As he surveys his enemies
He dispersed he gave to the poor His righteousness continues unto ages of ages His horn shall be exalted with glory
The sinner shall see this and be angry He shall gnash his teeth and be consumed The desire of sinners shall perish
Alleluia Praise the Lord O you servants Praise the name of the Lord
Blessed be the name of the Lord From this present time and unto the ages
From the rising of the sun toits setting Praise the name of the Lord
The Lord is high above all the nations His glory is above the heavens
Who is like the Lord our God Who dwells in the highest
And who looks upon the humble things In heaven and on earth
He raises the poor man from the earth And lifts up the poor from the dunghills
So as to seat him with rulers With the rulers of His people
He settles the barren woman in a home To be a joyful mother of children
Alleluia In the exodus of Israel from Egypt The house of Jacob from a foreign people
Judah became His sanctuary And Israel His authority
The sea saw them and fled The Jordan turned back
The mountains skipped like rams The hills like flocks of lambs
What is it to you O sea that you fled And to you O Jordan that you turned back
What is it to you O mountains that you skipped like rams And you O hills like flocks of lambs
The earth shook because of the Lords face Because of the face of Jacobs God
When He turned the rock into pools of waters And flinty ground into fountains of waters
Not to us O Lord not to us But to Your name give glory For Your mercy and Your truth
Lest the nations say Where is their God
Our God is in heaven above And both in heaven and on earth All things whatsoever He wills He does
The idols of the nations are silver and gold The work of mens hands
They have a mouth but they shall not speak They have eyes but they shall not see
They have ears but they shall not hear They have noses but they shall not smell
They have hands but they shall not feel They have feet but they shall not walk They shall make no sound with their throats
May those who make them become like them And all who trust in them
The house of Israel hoped in the Lord He is their help and their protector
The house of Aaron hoped in the Lord He is their help and their protector
Those who feared the Lord hoped in the Lord He is their help and their protector
The Lord remembered us and blessed us He blessed the house of Israel He blessed the house of Aaron
He blessed those who feared the Lord The least with the greatest
May the Lord increase you Both you and your children
You are blessed by the Lord Who made heaven and earth
The heaven of heaven belongs to the Lord But He gave the earth to the sons of men
The dead shall not praise You O Lord Neither doall whodescend into Hades
But we who live shall bless the Lord From this present time and unto the ages
Alleluia Ihave loved because the Lord Shall hear the voice of my supplication
For He inclined His ear to me And in my days I shall call upon Him
The pains of death surrounded me The dangers of Hades found me I found affliction and grief
Then I called upon the Lords name O Lord save my soul
The Lord is merciful and righteous And our God has mercy
The Lord is He who watches over children I was humbled and He saved me
Return O my soul to your rest Because the Lord showed you kindness
For He delivered my soul from death My eyes from tears And my feet from slipping
I shall be well pleasing before the Lord in the land of the living
Alleluia Ibelieved therefore I spoke I was greatly humbled
I said in my ecstasy Every man is a liar
What shall I give back to the Lord For all He rendered to me
Iwill take up the cup of salvation And call upon the name of the Lord
Precious in the sight of the Lord Is the death of His holy ones
O Lord I am Your servant I am Your servant and the son of Your handmaid You broke apart my bonds
I will offer a sacrifice of praise
I shall pay my vows to the Lord In the presence of all His people
In the courts of the Lords house In your midst O Jerusalem

The Lord is my helper I shall not be afraid of what man will do to me
The Lord is my helper I shall look upon my enemies
It is good to trust in the Lord Rather than to trust in man
It is good to hope in the Lord Rather than to hope in rulers
All the nations surrounded me But in the name of the Lord I defended myself against them
They circled and surrounded me But in the name of the Lord I defended myself against them
They surrounded me like bees around a honeycomb And they were inflamed like fire in a thorn bush But in the name of the Lord I defended myself against them
I was shoved and disheartened that I might fall But the Lord took hold of me
The Lord is my strength and my song And He became my salvation
The sound of exceeding joy and salvation is in the tents of the righteous The right hand of the Lord worked its power

Open the gates of righteousness to me I will enter therein and give thanks to the Lord
This is the gate of the Lord The righteous shall go in through it
I will give thanks to You for You heard me And You became my salvation
The stone the builders rejected the same became the head of the corner
And this came about from the Lord And it is wonderful in our eyes

O Lord save us now O Lord prosper us now
Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord We blessed you from the house of the Lord

Alleluia Blessed are the blameless in the way Who walk in the law of the Lord
Blessed are those who search out His testimonies They shall search for Him with their whole heart
For those who work lawlessness Do not walk in His ways
You commanded us regarding Your commandments That we should be very diligent to keep them
Would that my ways were led That I might keep Your ordinances
Then I would not be ashamed When I regard all Your commandments
I will give thanks to You O Lord with an upright heart When I learn the judgments of Your righteousness
I shall keep Your ordinances Do not utterly forsake me
How shall a young man keep his way straight When he keeps Your words
I searched for You with my whole heart Do not drive me away from Your commandments
I hid Your teachings in my heart So as not to sin against You
Blessed are You O Lord Teach me Your ordinances
With my lips I declared All the judgments of Your mouth
I delight in the way of Your testimonies As much as in all riches
I shall meditate on Your commandments And I shall understand Your ways
I shall meditate on Your ordinances I shall not forget Your words
Reward Your servant I shall live and keep Your words
Unveil my eyes And I shall understand the wonders in Your law
I am a sojourner on the earth Do not hide Your commandments from me
My soul longed to desire Your judgments in every season
You rebuke the arrogant Those who turn aside from Your commandments are accursed
Take away reproach and contempt from me For I searched Your testimonies
For rulers sat and spoke against me But Your servant meditated on Your ordinances
For Your testimonies are my meditation And Your ordinances are my counsels
My soul cleaves to the earth Give me life according to Your word

And may Your mercy come upon me O Lord Your salvation according to Your teaching
And I shall answer those who insult me with a word For I hope in Your words
Do not take away the word of truth completely from my mouth For I hope in Your judgments
So I shall keep Your law always Forever and untoages of ages
And I walk in a broad space For I searched Your commandments
I spoke of Your testimonies Before kings and I was not ashamed
And I meditate on Your commandments Which I love exceedingly
And I raise my hands to Your commandments which I love And I meditate on Your ordinances
Remember Your word to Your servant In which You give me hope
This comforted me in my humiliation For Your teaching gives me life
The arrogant transgressed exceedingly But I did not turn away from Your law
I remembered Your judgments of old O Lord And I was comforted
Despondency held me because of sinners Who abandon Your law
Your ordinances were sung to me In the place of my sojourning
I remembered Your name in the night O Lord And I kept Your law
This happened to me in the night Because I searched Your ordinances
You are my portion O Lord I said I will keep Your law
I sought Your presence with my whole heart Have mercy on me according to Your teaching
I considered Your ways And I turned my feet toward Your testimonies
I prepared myself and I was not troubled That I might keep Your commandments
The ropes of sinners ensnared me But I did not forget Your law
At midnight Iarose togive thanks to You Because of the judgments of Your righteousness
I am a companion of all who fear You And keep Your commandments
O Lord the earth is full of Your mercy Teach me Your ordinances
O Lord You dealt with Your servant in goodness According to Your word

Your hands made and fashioned me Instruct me and I will learn Your commandments
Those who fear You will see me and be glad Because I hope in Your words

My eyes strained to look at Your teaching Saying When will You comfort me
I am like a leather bag in a frost I did not forget Your ordinances
How many are the days of Your servant When will You execute judgment for me upon those whopersecute me
Transgressors described their meditations to me But these are not like Your law O Lord
All Your commandments are truth They persecuted me unjustly help me
They almost ended my life on earth But I did not forsake Your commandments
Give me life according to Your mercy And I shall keep the testimonies of Your mouth
Forever O Lord Your word continues in heaven

An ode of ascents To the Lord in my affliction I cried out and He heard me
O Lord deliver my soul from unjust lips And from a deceitful tongue
What should be given You and what added to You Against a deceitful tongue
The arrows of the Mighty One are sharpened With hot coals from the desert
Woe is me My sojourning was prolonged I dwelt with the tents of Kedar
My soul sojourned a long time as a resident alien
With those who hate peace I was peaceful When I spoke to them they made war against me without cause
1An ode of ascents Ilifted my eyes to the mountains From where shall my help come
My help comes from the Lord Who made heaven and earth
Let not your foot be moved Neither let Him who keeps you slumber
Behold He whokeeps Israel Shall neither slumber nor sleep
The Lord shall keep you The Lord is your shelter at your right hand
The sun shall not burn you by day Nor the moon by night
The Lord shall keep you from all evil The Lord shall keep your soul
The Lord shall keep your coming in and your going out From this present time and unto the ages
1An ode of ascents Iwas glad when they said to me Let us go into the house of the Lord
Our feet stand in your courts O Jerusalem
Jerusalem is built as a city Whose compactness is complete
There the tribes went up The tribes of the Lord a testimony to Israel To give thanks to the name of the Lord
For thrones sat there for judgment Thrones over the house of David
Ask now for things regarding the peace of Jerusalem And there is prosperity for those who love you
Let there now be peace in your power And prosperity in your citadels
For the sake of my brothers and my neighbors I indeed spoke peace concerning you
For the sake of the house of the Lord our God I sought good things for you
1An ode of ascents Ilift my eyes to You Whodwell in heaven
Behold as the eyes of servants look to the hands of their masters As the eyes of the maidservant look to the hands of her mistress So our eyes look to the Lord our God Until He shall have compassion on us
Have mercy on us O Lord have mercy on us For we are greatly filled with contempt
Our soul is greatly filled with it We are a disgrace to those who prosper And a contempt to the arrogant
1An ode of ascents I f the Lord had not been with us Let Israel now say
If the Lord had not been with us When men rose up against us
Then they would have swallowed us alive When their anger raged against us
Then the water would have drowned us Our soul would have passed through a torrent
Then our soul would have passed through A water that is overwhelming
Blessed is the Lord Who did not give us as prey to their teeth
Our soul was delivered like a sparrow From the snare of the hunters The snare was broken and we were delivered
Our help is in the name of the Lord Who made heaven and earth
1An ode of ascents Those who trust in the Lord are like Mount Zion He whodwells in Jerusalem shall be unshaken forever
The mountains surround her And the Lord surrounds His people From this present time and unto the ages
The Lord will not permit the rod of sinners To be upon the inheritance of the righteous Lest the righteous stretch out Their hands in lawlessness
Do good O Lord to the good And to the upright in heart
But those who turn aside to crooked ways The Lord shall lead away with the workers of lawlessness Peace be upon Israel
1An ode of ascents When the Lord returned the captives of Zion We became like those who are comforted
Then our mouth was filled with joy And our tongue with exceeding joy Then they shall say among the Gentiles The Lord did great things with them
The Lord has done great things with us We were glad
Return O Lord our captivity Like streams in the south
Those who sow with tears Shall reap with exceeding joy
They went forth and wept Carrying their seeds with them But they shall return with exceeding joy Carrying their sheaves
1An ode of ascents for Solomon Unless the Lord builds the house Those who build it labor in vain Unless the Lord guard the city Those who guard it stay awake in vain
It is in vain for you to rise early To awaken from your rest You who eat the bread of grief When He gives His beloved ones sleep
Behold children are the Lords inheritance The fruit of the womb His reward
Like arrows in the hand of a mighty one So are the children of those who were outcasts
Blessed is the man who shall fulfill his desire with them They shall not be ashamed when they speak to their enemies at the gate
1An ode of ascents Blessed are all who fear the Lord Who walk in His ways
You shall eat the fruits of your labor You are blessed and it shall be well with you
Your wife shall be like a vine prospering on the sides of your house Your children like newly planted olive trees Around your table
Behold so shall the man be blessed who fears the Lord
May the Lord bless you from Zion And may you see the good things of Jerusalem All the days of your life
May you see your childrens children Peace be upon Israel
1An ode of ascents M any times they warred against me from my youth Let Israel now say 2Many times they warred against me from my youth Yet they did not overcome me
The sinners schemed behind my back They prolonged their lawlessness
The righteous Lord cut in pieces the necks of sinners
Let all who hate Zion Be shamed and turned back
Let them become like grass on the housetops Which withers before it is plucked up
Like grass with which the reaper does not fill his hand Nor the gatherer of sheaves his bosom
Neither do those who pass by say to them The Lords blessing be upon you In the Lords name we bless you
1An ode of ascents Out of the depths I have cried to You O Lord
O Lord hear my voice Let Your ears be attentive To the voice of my supplication
If You O Lord should mark transgression O Lord who would stand
For there is forgiveness with You
Because of Your law O Lord I waited for You My soul waited for Your word
My soul hopes in the Lord From the morning watch until night From the morning watch until night Let Israel hope in the Lord
For with the Lord there is mercy And with Him is abundant redemption
And He shall redeem Israel From all his transgressions
1An ode of ascents by David OLord My heart is not exalted Neither are my eyes raised up Neither am I carried along in great things Nor in things too marvelous for me
If I were not humbleminded But exalted my soul Like a child weaned from his mother So You would reward my soul
Let Israel hope in the Lord From this present time and unto the ages
1An ode of ascents Remember David O Lord And all his meekness
How he swore to the Lord How he vowed to the God of Jacob 3Ishall not enter my dwelling I shall not recline on my bed
I shall not close my eyes in sleep Nor my eyelids for dozing Nor give any rest to my temples
Until I find a place for the Lord A tabernacle for the God of Jacob
Behold we heard of it in Ephrathah We found it in the plains of the wood
Let us enter into His tabernacles Let us worship at the place where His feet stood
Arise O Lord into Your rest You and the ark of Your holiness
Your priests shall clothe themselves in righteousness Your saints shall greatly rejoice
For Your servant Davids sake Do not turn away from the face of Your anointed
The Lord swore to David this truth and He shall not reject it I shall set upon your throne one from the fruit of your loins
If your sons keep My covenant And these testimonies I shall teach them Then their sons shall sit upon your throne forever
For the Lord has chosen Zion He chose her for His dwelling
This is My place of rest unto ages of ages Here I shall dwell for I have chosen her
Blessing I shall bless her provision I shall satisfy her poor with bread
And I shall clothe her priests with salvation And her saints shall rejoice exceedingly with great joy
There I shall cause to spring up a horn for David There I prepared a lamp for my anointed
His enemies I shall clothe with shame Upon him shall My sanctification flourish
1An ode of ascents by David Behold now what is so good or so pleasant As for brothers to dwell together in unity
It is like fragrant oil running down upon the beard The beard of Aaron Running down upon the border of his garment
It is like the dew of Hermon running down upon the mountains of Zion For there the Lord commanded the blessing And life forever
1An ode of ascents Behold now bless the Lord All you servants of the Lord Who stand in the house of the Lord In the courts of the house of our God
In the nights lift up your hands to the holy of holies And bless the Lord
May the Lord bless you from Zion He who made heaven and earth
Alleluia Praise the name of the Lord O you servants praise the Lord
You who stand in the house of the Lord In the courts of the house of our God
Praise the Lord for the Lord is good Sing to His name for it is good
For the Lord chose Jacob for Himself Israel for His special treasure
For I know the Lord is great And our Lord is above all the gods
All things whatsoever the Lord willed He did In heaven and on the earth In the seas and in all deep places
Bringing clouds from the furthest part of the earth He made lightning for the rain Bringing winds from His storehouses
He struck the firstborn of Egypt From man to cattle
He sent forth signs and wonders in your midst O Egypt Among Pharaoh and all his servants
He struck many nations And destroyed mighty kings
Sihon king of the Amorites And Og king of Bashan And all the kingdoms of Canaan
And He gave their land as an inheritance An inheritance for Israel His people
O Lord Your name abides forever O Lord Your memorial unto generation and generation
For the Lord will judge His people And He shall comfort His servants
The idols of the nations are silver and gold The works of mens hands
They have a mouth but they shall not speak They have eyes but they shall not see
They have ears but they shall not hear They have noses but they shall not smell They have hands but they shall not feel They have feet but they shall not walk They have no sound in their throat For neither is there breath in their mouth
May those who made them become like them And all who trust in them
O house of Israel bless the Lord O house of Aaron bless the Lord
O house of Levi bless the Lord You whofear the Lord bless the Lord
Blessed be the Lord out of Zion He who dwells in Jerusalem
1Alleluia Give thanks to the Lord for He is good For His mercy endures forever
Give thanks to the God of gods For His mercy endures forever
Give thanks to the Lord of lords For His mercy endures forever
To Him who alone does great wonders For His mercy endures forever
To Him who made the heavens with understanding For His mercy endures forever
To Him who made firm the earth on the waters For His mercy endures forever
To Him who alone made the great lights For His mercy endures forever
The sun for authority over the day For His mercy endures forever
The moon and stars for authority over the night For His mercy endures forever
To Him who struck down Egypt with their firstborn For His mercy endures forever
To Him who led Israel out of their midst For His mercy endures forever
With a strong hand and an upraised arm For His mercy endures forever
To Him who divided the Red Sea into parts For His mercy endures forever
And led Israel through the midst of it For His mercy endures forever
And whooverthrew Pharaoh and all his host in the Red Sea For His mercy endures forever
To Him who led His people through the wilderness For His mercy endures forever To Him who drew water from the hard rock For His mercy endures forever
To Him who struck down great kings For His mercy endures forever
And killed mighty kings For His mercy endures forever
Sihon king of the Amorites For His mercy endures forever
And Og king of Bashan For His mercy endures forever
And who gave their land as an inheritance For His mercy endures forever
An inheritance for Israel His servant For His mercy endures forever
For in our humiliation the Lord remembered us For His mercy endures forever
And He redeemed us from our enemies For His mercy endures forever
Who gave food to all flesh For His mercy endures forever
Give thanks to the God of heaven For His mercy endures forever Give thanks to the Lord of lords For His mercy endures forever
By David By the rivers of Babylon There we sat and wept When we remembered Zion
Upon the willows in her midst We hung up our musical instruments
For there our captors asked us for words from our songs And those who carried us off said to us Sing us the songs of Zion
How shall we sing the Lords song In a foreign land
If I forget you O Jerusalem May my right hand be forgotten
May my tongue be glued to my throat If Idonot remember you If I do not prefer Jerusalem In the beginning of my merriment
O Lord remember the sons of Edom On that day in Jerusalem When they were saying Empty it out Empty it out Even to its foundation
O wretched daughter of Babylon Blessed is he who shall deal with you As you dealt with us
Blessed is he who shall get the upper hand And dash your infants against the rock
By David Iwill give thanks to You O Lord with all my heart For You hear the words of my mouth And I shall sing to You in the presence of angels
I shall bow down and worship toward Your holy temple And I will give thanks to Your name For Your mercy and Your truth For You magnified Your teaching above every name
On the day Ishall call out to You hear me speedily You shall treat my soul with great care in Your power
O Lord let all the kings of the earth give thanks to You For they heard all the words of Your mouth
And let them sing in the ways of the Lord For the glory of the Lord is great
For the Lord is high and He watches over the lowly things But the high things He knows from afar
If I walk in the midst of affliction You shall make me live You stretched out Your hand against the wrath of my enemies And Your right hand saved me
The Lord shall repay them on my behalf O Lord Your mercy endures forever Do not forsake the works of Your hands
For the End a psalm by David OLord You test me and know me
You know my sitting down and my rising up You understand my thoughts from afar
You search out my path and my portion And You foresee all my ways
For there is not a word on my tongue
But behold O Lord You know it altogether The last things and the first things You fashioned me and placed Your hands on me
Your knowledge has become too wondrous for me It has become too overwhelming I am unable to grasp it
Where could I go from Your Spirit Or flee from Your face
If I should ascend into heaven You would be there If I should descend into Hades You would be there
If I should take up my wings at dawn And pitch camp at the furthest part of the sea
Even there Your hand would lead me And Your right hand would hold me
And I said Perhaps darkness shall cover me But the night shall be light to my delight
For darkness shall not be dark because of You And the night shall be bright as day As its darkness so also shall be its light
For You possess my heart O Lord You took hold of me from my mothers womb
I will give thanks to You For I am fearfully and wondrously made Marvelous are Your works And my soul knows this very well
My bone you made in secret was not hidden from You And my substance was in the lowest parts of the earth
Your eyes saw me when I was unformed And all men shall be written in Your book They shall be formed day by day When as yet there were none among them
Your friends O God became very honorable to me Their principalities became very strong
I shall count them And they shall be multiplied more than the sand I awakened and I am still with You
If You should slay sinners O God You would turn aside from me O men of blood
For You will say regarding their reasoning They shall receive your cities in vain
Have I not hated those who hate You O Lord And was I not wasting away because of Your enemies
I hated them with perfect hatred They became my enemies
Test me O God and know my heart Examine me and know my paths
And see if there is a lawless way in me And lead me in the way everlasting
For the End a psalm by David Deliver me O Lord from the evil man Rescue me from the unjust man
Who devised wrongdoing in their heart They arrayed themselves for war all day long
They sharpened their tongue like a serpent The venom of asps was under their lips Pause
Keep me O Lord from the hand of the sinner Deliver me from unjust men Who plotted to trip up my steps
The arrogant hid a trap for me And they stretched out ropes as snares for my feet They set a stumbling block for me near my path Pause
I said to the Lord You are my God Give ear O Lord to the voice of my supplication
O Lord O Lord the power of my salvation You overshadowed my head in the day of war
Because of my desire O Lord do not hand me over to the sinner They plotted against me do not forsake me lest they be exalted Pause
As for the head of those who encircle me The toil of their lips shall cover them
Coals shall fall upon them You shall overthrow them with fire Do not let them withstand hardships
A talkative man shall not prosper on earth Evils shall hunt the unjust man to destruction
I know the Lord will maintain the cause of the poor man And the justice of the needy
Surely the righteous shall give thanks to Your name And the upright shall dwell in Your presence
A psalm by David OLord I have cried to You hear me Give heed to the voice of my supplication when I cry to You
Let my prayer be set forth before You as incense The lifting up of my hands as the evening sacrifice
Set a watch O Lord before my mouth A door of enclosure about my lips
Incline not my heart to evil words To make excuses in sins With men who work lawlessness And Iwill not join with their choice ones
The righteous man shall correct me With mercy and he shall reprove me But let not the oil of the sinner anoint my head For my prayer shall be intense in the presence of their pleasures
Their judges are swallowed up by the rock They shall hear my words for they are pleasant
As a clod of ground is dashed to pieces on the earth So our bones were scattered beside the grave
For my eyes O Lord O Lord are toward You In You I hope take not my soul away
Keep me from the snares they set for me And from the stumbling blocks of those who work lawlessness
Sinners shall fall into their own net I am alone until I escape
1Understanding by David when he was in the cave a prayer Icried to the Lord with my voice With my voice I prayed to the Lord
I shall pour out my supplication before Him I shall declare my affliction in His presence
When my spirit fainted within me Then You knew my paths For on the way Iwas going they hid a trap for me
I looked on my right and saw There was no one who knew me Refuge failed me And there was no one who cared for my soul
I cried to You O Lord I said You are my hope My portion in the land of the living
Attend to my supplication For I was humbled exceedingly Deliver me from my persecutors For they are stronger than I
Bring my soul out of prison To give thanks to Your name O Lord The righteous shall wait for me until You reward me
A psalm by David when his son persecuted him OLord hear my prayer Give ear to my supplication in Your truth Answer me in Your righteousness
Do not enter into judgment with Your servant For no one living shall become righteous in Your sight
For the enemy persecuted my soul He humbled my life to the ground He caused me to dwell in dark places as one long dead
And my spirit was in anguish within me My heart was troubled within me
I remembered the days of old And I meditated on all Your works I meditated on the works of Your hands
I spread out my hands to You My soul thirsts for You like a waterless land Pause
Hear me speedily O Lord My spirit faints within me Turn not Your face from me Lest I become like those who go down into the pit
Cause me to hear Your mercy in the morning For I hope in You Make me know O Lord the way wherein I should walk For I lift up my soul to You
Deliver me from my enemies O Lord For to You I flee for refuge
Teach me to do Your will for You are my God Your good Spirit shall guide me in the land of uprightness
For Your names sake O Lord give me life In Your righteousness You shall bring my soul out of affliction
In Your mercy You shall destroy my enemies You shall utterly destroy all who afflict my soul For I am Your servant
By David against Goliath Blessed is the Lord my God Who trains my hands for battle My fingers for war
He is my mercy and my refuge My helper and my deliverer My protector in whom I hope Who subjects my people under me
O Lord what is man that You are made known to him Or the son of man that You consider him
Man is become like vanity His days like a passing shadow
O Lord bow down Your heavens and descend Touch the mountains and they shall smoke
Flash lightning and You shall scatter them Shoot Your arrows and You shall trouble them
Send forth Your hand from on high Deliver me and save me from great waters From the hand of the sons of foreigners
Whose mouth speaks empty things And their right hand is the right hand of wrongdoing
O God I shall sing a new song to You I shall play to You on a harp of ten strings
To Him who gives salvation to kings Who redeems David His servant from the evil sword
Deliver me and save me from the hand of the sons of foreigners Whose mouth speaks empty things And their right hand is a right hand of wrongdoing
Whose sons are like new plants Matured in their youth Their daughters beautified Adorned like a temple
Their storehouses are full Bursting forth with abundance on all sides Their sheep give many births Multiplying in their streets
Their oxen are fat There is no gap in their fence or passage Nor outcry in their streets
They call the people blessed whose lot this is But rather blessed is the people Whose God is the Lord
A praise by David Ishall exalt You my God and my King And I shall bless Your name forever and unto ages of ages
Every day I shall bless You And praise Your name forever and unto ages of ages
Great is the Lord and exceedingly praiseworthy And His greatness has no limit
Generation and generation shall praise Your works And they shall declare Your power
They shall speak of the magnificence of the glory of Your holiness And they shall describe Your wonders
They shall also speak of the power of Your awesome deeds And describe Your great majesty
They shall overflow with the memory of Your rich goodness And shall greatly rejoice in Your righteousness
The Lord is gracious and merciful Longsuffering and abundant in mercy
The Lord is good to all And His mercies are upon all His works
O Lord let all Your works praise You And Your holy ones bless You
They shall tell of Your kingdoms glory And they shall speak of Your power
That all the sons of men may know Your power And the glory of Your kingdoms magnificence
Your kingdom is a kingdom of all the ages And Your dominion is from generation to generation The Lord is faithful in His words And holy in all His works
The Lord supports all who stumble And restores all who are broken down
All eyes hope in You And You give them their food in due season
You open Your hand And fill every living thing with Your pleasure
The Lord is righteous in all His ways And holy in all His works
The Lord is near to all who call on Him To all who call upon Him in truth
He shall do the will of those who fear Him And He shall hear their supplications and save them
The Lord keeps all who love Him But all the sinners He shall utterly destroy
My mouth shall speak the Lords praise And let all flesh bless His holy name Forever and unto ages of ages
Alleluia of Aggeus and Zacharias Praise the Lord O my soul
I shall praise the Lord while I live I shall sing to my God as long as I exist
Do not trust in rulers and in the sons of men In whom there is nosalvation
His breath shall go out of him and he shall return to his earth On that day all his thoughts shall perish
Blessed is he whose help is the God of Jacob His hope is in the Lord his God
Who made heaven and earth The sea and everything in them Who keeps truth forever
Who executes justice for the wronged Who provides food for the hungry The Lord frees those bound
The Lord restores those broken down The Lord gives wisdom to the blind The Lord loves the righteous
The Lord keeps watch over resident aliens He shall adopt the orphan and the widow But He shall destroy the way of sinners
The Lord shall reign forever Your God O Zion to all generations
Alleluia of Aggeus and Zacharias Praise the Lord for a psalm is a good thing Let praise be sweet toour God
The Lord is building Jerusalem And He shall gather together the dispersion of Israel
He heals the brokenhearted And He binds up all their wounds
He numbers the multitude of stars And calls them all by name
Great is our Lord and great is His strength His understanding exceeds every measure
The Lord raises up the gentle But humbles sinners to the ground
Begin with thanksgiving tothe Lord Sing to our God with the harp
To Him who covers heaven with clouds Who prepares rain for the earth Who makes grass grow on the mountains And the green growth for the service of men
To Him who gives the cattle their food And who gives food to the nestlings of ravens When they call upon Him
He shall not take pleasure in the strength of a horse Nor be pleased with the legs of a man
The Lord is pleased with those who fear Him And with those who hope in His mercy
Alleluia of Aggeus and Zacharias Praise the Lord O Jerusalem Praise your God O Zion
For He strengthens the bars of your gates He blesses your children within you
He who grants your borders peace And fills you with the finest of wheat
He who sends His teaching to earth Until His word shall run swiftly
Giving snow like wool Sprinkling mist like ashes
Casting His ice like morsels Who shall withstand His winter
He shall send His word and melt them His wind shall blow and the waters shall flow
He who declares His word to Jacob His ordinances and judgments to Israel
He did not do so with other nations Nor did He show His judgments to them
Alleluia of Aggeus and Zacharias Praise the Lord from the heavens Praise Him in the highest
Praise Him all you His angels Praise Him all you His hosts
Praise Him sun and moon Praise Him all you stars and light
Praise Him you heavens of heavens And you waters above the heavens
Let them praise the Lords name For He spoke and they were made He commanded and they were created
He established them forever and unto ages of ages He set forth His ordinance and it shall not pass away
Praise the Lord from the earth You dragons and all the deeps
Fire and hail snow and ice Stormy wind which perform His word
Mountains and all the hills Fruitful trees and all cedars
Wild animals and all cattle Creeping things and flying birds
Kings of the earth and all peoples Princes and all judges of the earth
Young men and maidens Elders with younger
Let them praise the Lords name For His name alone is exalted His thanksgiving is in earth and heaven
And He shall exalt the horn of His people A hymn for all His saints For the children of Israel a people who draw near to Him
1Alleluia Sing to the Lord a new song His praise in the assembly of His holy ones
Let Israel be glad in Him who made him And let the children of Zion greatly rejoice in their King
Let them praise His name with dance With tambourine and harp let them sing to Him
For the Lord is pleased with His people And He shall exalt the gentle with salvation
The holy ones shall boast in glory And they shall greatly rejoice on their beds
The high praise of God shall be in their mouth And a twoedged sword in their hand
To deal retribution to the nations Reproving among the peoples
To shackle their kings with chains And their nobles with fetters of iron
To fulfill among them the written judgment This glory have all His holy ones
1Alleluia Praise God in His saints Praise Him in the firmament of His power
Praise Him for His mighty acts Praise Him according to the abundance of His greatness
Praise Him with the sound of a trumpet Praise Him with the harp and lyre
Praise Him with timbrel and dance Praise Him with strings and flute
Praise Him with resounding cymbals Praise Him with triumphant cymbals
Let everything that breathes praise the Lord Alleluia
1This is a psalm written with Davids own hand although outside the number when he  fought in single combat with Goliath Iwas small among my brothers And the youngest in my fathers house I tended my fathers sheep
My hands built a musical instrument My fingers tuned a lyre
And whoshall tell my Lord The Lord Himself He Himself hears
He sent forth His Angel And took me from my fathers sheep And he anointed me with his anointing oil
My brothers were handsome and tall But the Lord took no pleasure in them
I went out to meet the foreigner And he cursed me with his idols
But I drew his own sword and beheaded him And removed disgrace from the children of Israel
Blessed is the man that hath not walked in the counsel of the ungodly, nor stood in the way of sinners, nor sat in the seat of the pestilent.
But his will is in the law of the Lord, and in His law shall he meditate day and night.
And he shall be like the tree planted by the streams of waters, that shall bring forth his fruit in his season; his leaf also shall not fall, and whatsoever he doeth shall prosper.
The ungodly are not so, not so: but are like the chaff which the wind driveth away from the face of the earth.
Therefore the ungodly shall not rise up in the judgment, nor sinners in the congregation of the righteous.
For the Lord knoweth the way of the righteous; but the way of the ungodly shall perish.
Why did the heathen rage, and the peoples imagine vain things?
The kings of the earth stood up, and the rulers were gathered together, against the Lord and against His Christ, saying,
Let us break their bands asunder, and cast away their yoke from us.
He that dwelleth in the heavens shall laugh them to scorn, and the Lord shall have them in derision.
Then shall He speak to them in His wrath, and vex them in His sore displeasure.
But I was established King by Him upon His holy mount of Zion, declaring the decree of the Lord.
The Lord hath said unto me, Thou art My Son; this day have I begotten Thee.
Ask of Me, and I shall give Thee the heathen for Thine inheritance, and the uttermost parts of the earth for Thy possession.
Thou shalt shepherd them with a rod of iron; Thou shalt dash them in pieces like a potter's vessels.
Be wise now therefore, O ye kings; be instructed, all ye judges of the earth.
Serve the Lord with fear, and rejoice in Him with trembling.
Embrace instruction, lest the Lord be angry, and ye perish from the righteous way, when His wrath is kindled suddenly.
Blessed are all they that put their trust in Him.
Lord, why are they increased that trouble me? many are they that rise up against me.
Many there be which say to my soul, There is no salvation for him in his God.
But Thou, O Lord, art my helper, my glory, and the lifter up of mine head.
I cried unto the Lord with my voice, and He heard me out of His holy mount.
I laid me down and slept; I arose, for the Lord will help me.
I will not be afraid of ten thousands of people, that have set themselves against me round about.
Arise, O Lord; save me, O my God: for Thou hast smitten all them that are mine enemies without a cause; Thou hast broken the teeth of sinners.
Salvation is of the Lord, and Thy blessing is upon Thy people.
Thou hast heard me when I called upon Thee, O God of my righteouness; Thou hast set me at liberty when I was in trouble. Have pity upon me, and hear my prayer.
O ye sons of men, how long will ye be slow of heart? Why love ye vanity, and seek after leasing?
But know that the Lord hath made His holy one wonderful; the Lord will hear me when I cry unto Him.
Be ye angry, and sin not; feel compunction upon your beds for what ye say in your hearts.
Offer the sacrifice of righteousness, and put your hope in the Lord. There be many that say, Who will shew us good things? The light of Thy countenance is signed upon us, O Lord.
Thou hast put gladness in my heart; from the fruit of their wheat, and wine and oil are they increased.
I will both lay me down in peace and sleep; for Thou, Lord, only hast made me to dwell in hope.
Give ear to my words, O Lord; understand my cry.
Give heed to the voice of my supplication, my King, and my God; for unto Thee will I pray, O Lord.
My voice shalt Thou hear in the morning; in the morning will I stand before Thee, and Thou shalt look upon me; for Thou art not a God that willeth iniquity.
Neither shall the evil doer dwell with Thee, nor shall transgressors stand in Thy sight.
Thou hatest all workers of iniquity; Thou shalt destroy all them that speak leasing.
The Lord will abhor the bloody and deceitful man.
But as for me, I will come into Thy house in the multitude of Thy mercy: in Thy fear will I worship toward Thy holy temple.
Guide me, O Lord, in Thy righteousness because of mine enemies; make my way straight before Thy face.
For there is no truth in their mouth; their heart is vain.
Their throat is an open sepulchre, they have deceived with their tongues; judge Thou them, O God.
Let them fall by their own counsels; cast them out according to the multitude of their ungodliness; for they have embittered Thee, O Lord.
But let all those that put their hope in Thee be glad; they shall rejoice for ever, and Thou shalt dwell in them, and all they that love Thy name shall glory in Thee,
For Thou wilt bless the righteous. O Lord, Thou hast crowned us as with a shield of Thy good pleasure.
O Lord, rebuke me not in Thine anger, neither chasten me in Thy wrath.
Have mercy upon me, O Lord, for I am weak: O Lord, heal me, for my bones are vexed, my soul is also sore vexed: but Thou, O Lord, how long?
Turn Thee, O Lord, deliver my soul; oh save me for Thy mercy's sake.
For in death there is none that is mindful of Thee, and in Hades who shall give Thee thanks?
I am weary with my groaning; every night will I wash my bed, I will water my couch with my tears.
Mine eye is troubled because of anger; I am waxen old among all mine enemies.
Depart from me, all ye workers of iniquity, for the Lord hath heard the voice of my weeping.
The Lord hath heard my supplication; the Lord hath received my prayer.
Let all my enemies be ashamed and sore vexed; let them be turned back, and be ashamed suddenly.
Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit, both now and ever, and unto the ages of ages. Amen. Alleluia, alleluia, alleluia, glory to Thee, O God. Alleluia, alleluia, alleluia, glory to Thee, O God. Alleluia, alleluia, alleluia, glory to Thee, O God.
Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit, both now and ever, and unto the ages of ages. Amen.
O Lord my God, in Thee have I put my hope: save me from all them that persecute me, and deliver me.
Lest at any time he seize my soul like a lion, while there is none to deliver or to save.
O Lord my God, if I have done this; if there be injustice in my hands;
If I have rewarded evils unto them that rendered me evils, then let me fall away empty from mine enemies.
Let the enemy pursue my soul, and take it; yea, let him tread down my life upon the earth, and lay my glory in the dust.
Arise, O Lord, in Thine anger; lift up Thyself to the uttermost borders of Thine enemies.
And awake, O Lord my God, according to the precept that Thou hast commanded, and a congregation of the peoples shall compass Thee about; for their sakes therefore return Thou on high.
The Lord shall judge the peoples. Judge me, O Lord, according to my righteousness, and according to mine innocency that is in me.
Oh let the wickedness of sinners come to an end; and Thou shalt direct the righteous, O God, that searchest the hearts and reins.
Righteous is my help from God, Which saveth the upright in heart.
God is a righteous judge, strong and forbearing, and inflicteth not anger every day.
If ye turn not, He will furbish His sword; He hath bent His bow, and made it ready.
He hath also prepared on it the instruments of death; He hath made ready His arrows for them that burn with rage.
Behold, he hath travailed with injustice; he hath conceived toil, and brought forth wickedness.
He opened a pit, and digged it, and shall fall into the ditch which he made.
His travail shall return upon his own head, and his injustice shall come down upon his own pate.
I will give thanks unto the Lord according to His righteousness, and will sing praise to the name of the Lord Most High.
O Lord our Lord, how wonderful is Thy Name in all the earth! For Thy majesty is exalted above the heavens.
Out of the mouths of babes and sucklings hast Thou perfected praise because of Thine enemies, that Thou mightest destroy the enemy and the avenger.
For I will consider the heavens, the works of Thy fingers, the moon and the stars, which Thou hast founded.
What is man, that Thou art mindful of him? or the son of man, that Thou visitest him?
Thou hast made him a little lower than the angels; Thou hast crowned him with glory and honour, and hast made him to have dominion over the works of Thy hands.
Thou hast put all things under his feet: all sheep and oxen, yea, and the beasts of the field.
The fowls of the air, and the fish of the sea, and whatsoever passeth through the paths of the sea.
O Lord our Lord, how wonderful is Thy Name in all the earth!
I will give thanks unto Thee, O Lord, with my whole heart; I will speak of all Thy marvellous works.
I will be glad and rejoice in Thee; I will sing praise to Thy name, O Thou Most High.
When mine enemies are turned back, they shall be weakened, and perish at Thy presence.
For Thou hast maintained my right and my cause; Thou satest in the throne, O Thou that judgest righteousness.
Thou hast rebuked the heathen, and the ungodly hath perished; Thou hast put out his name for ever and ever.
The swords of the enemy have utterly failed, and Thou hast destroyed his cities.
His memory hath perished with a loud noise, but the Lord endureth for ever.
He hath prepared His throne for judgment, and He shall judge the world in righteousness, He shall minister judgement to the peoples in uprightness.
The Lord also is become a refuge for the poor, a helper in due season in tribulations.
And let them that know Thy name put their hope in Thee; for Thou, Lord, hast not forsaken them that seek Thee.
Sing praises to the Lord, Which dwelleth in Zion; declare among the nations His doings.
For He that requireth blood hath remembered them; He hath not forgotten the cry of the poor.
Have mercy upon me, O God; consider my humiliation which I suffer of mine enemies, Thou that liftest me up from the gates of death:
That I may shew forth all Thy praises in the gates of the daughter of Zion: we will rejoice in Thy salvation.
The heathen are stuck fast in the destruction that they wrought; in the very snare which they hid is their own foot taken.
The Lord is known by the judgments which He executeth; the sinner is snared in the works of his own hands.
Let sinners be turned away into Hades, all the nations that forget God.
For the needy shall not alway be forgotten; the patience of the poor shall not perish for ever.
Arise, O Lord, let not man prevail; let the heathen be judged in Thy sight.
O Lord, set a lawgiver over them; let the nations know themselves to be but men.
Why hast Thou stood afar off, O Lord? Why overlookest thou us in times of need, in troubles?
Whilst the ungodly man is proud, the poor man burneth within; they are caught in the devices that they imagine.
For the sinner praiseth himself for his soul's desires, and the unrighteous blesseth himself therein.
The sinner hath provoked the Lord; in the multitude of his wrath he will not seek Him; God is not before him.
His ways are profane at all times; Thy judgments are removed out of his sight; he will gain dominion over all his enemies.
For he hath said in his heart, I shall not be moved; from generation to generation shall I be without adversity.
His mouth is full of cursing and bitterness and fraud; under his tongue are toil and travail.
He sitteth in ambush with the rich in secret places, that he may slay the innocent; his eyes are set against the poor.
He lieth in wait secretly as a lion in his den; he lieth in wait to seize the poor, to seize the poor when he draweth him in.
In his snare will he humble himself; he will crouch and fall when he gaineth mastery over the poor.
For he hath said in his heart, God hath forgotten; He hath turned away His face, that He may never see.
Arise, O Lord my God, let Thine hand be lifted up; forget not Thy poor to the end.
Wherefore hath the ungodly provoked God? for he hath said in his heart, He will not require it.
Thou seest it, for Thou beholdest toil and wrath, to deliver him into Thy hands.
The poor is left unto Thee, for Thou art the helper of the fatherless.
Break Thou the arm of the sinner and the evil man; his sin shall be sought out, and shall be found no more.
The Lord is King for ever, yea for ever and ever; ye heathen shall perish out of His land.
Lord, Thou hast heard the desire of the poor; Thine ear hath been attentive to the preparation of their heart.
To judge for the fatherless and the humble; that man may no more presume to magnify himself upon the earth.
In the Lord put I my trust; how will ye say to my soul, Flee as a sparrow to the mountains?
For lo, the sinners have bent their bow, they have made ready their arrows for the quiver, that they may shoot in darkness at the upright in heart.
For they have destroyed the things that Thou hast made; but what hath the righteous done?
The Lord is in His holy temple, the Lord's throne is in heaven; His eyes behold the poor, His eyelids try the sons of men.
The Lord trieth the righteous and the ungodly; but he that loveth unrighteousness hateth his own soul.
Upon sinners He shall rain snares; fire and brimstone and wind of tempest shall be the portion of their cup.
For the Lord is righteous, and loveth righteousness; His countenance doth behold uprightness.
Save me, O Lord, for there is no more a godly man; for truths fail from among the sons of men.
They have spoken vanity, every one with his neighbour; with deceitful lips, and with a double heart have they spoken evils.
The Lord destroy all deceitful lips, and the tongue that speaketh proud things;
Who have said, Our tongue will we magnify, our lips are our own; who is lord over us?
For the misery of the poor, and the groaning of the needy, now will I arise, saith the Lord. I will set them in salvation, I shall be revealed therein.
The words of the Lord are pure words; as silver that is fired, tried in the earth, purified seven times.
Thou shalt keep us, O Lord, and preserve us from this generation, and for ever.
The ungodly walk on every side; according to Thy highness hast Thou esteemed the sons of men.
How long wilt Thou forget me, O Lord? for ever? How long wilt Thou turn away Thy face from me?
How long shall I take counsel in my soul, having sorrows in my heart day and night?
How long shall mine enemy be exalted over me?
Consider and hear me, O Lord my God; lighten mine eyes, lest I sleep in death;
Lest mine enemy say at any time, I have prevailed against him.
Those that trouble me will rejoice if I am moved, but I have hoped in Thy mercy.
My heart shall rejoice in Thy salvation; I will sing unto the Lord, Which hath dealt bountifully with me; yea, I will sing praise unto the name of the Lord Most High.
The fool hath said in his heart, There is no God.
They are corrupt, and are become abominable in their doings; there is none that doeth good, no, not one.
The Lord looked down from heaven upon the sons of men, to see if there were any that did understand, or seek God.
They are all gone aside, they are together become unprofitable; there is none that doeth good, no, not one.
Shall all the workers of iniquity have no knowledge, who eat up my people as they eat bread? They have not called upon the Lord.
There were they in great fear, where there was no fear; for the Lord is in the generation of the righteous.
Ye have shamed the counsel of the poor, but the Lord is his hope.
Who shall give the salvation of Israel out of Zion? When the Lord turneth back the captivity of His people, Jacob shall rejoice, and Israel shall be glad.
Lord, who shall abide in Thy tabernacle, and who shall dwell in Thy holy mount?
He that walketh blameless, and worketh righteousness, and speaketh the truth in his heart.
He that hath not deceived with his tongue, nor done evil to his neighbour, nor taken up a reproach against those nearest him.
In his sight the evil doer is contemned; but he glorifieth them that fear the Lord.
He that sweareth to his neighbour, and forsweareth not; he hath not put out his money to usury, nor taken bribes against the innocent.
He that doeth these things shall never be moved.
Preserve me, O Lord, for in Thee have I put my hope. I said unto the Lord, Thou art my Lord, for Thou hast no need of my goods.
In the saints that are in His earth hath the Lord wrought wonders; He hath fulfilled all His desires in them.
Their infirmities were multiplied; they hastened afterwards.
Their meetings for blood will I not assemble, nor make remembrance of their names by my lips.
The Lord is the portion of mine inheritance and of my cup; it is Thou that restorest mine inheritance to me.
Portions are fallen unto me among the best places, for mine inheritance is most excellent to me.
I will bless the Lord, Who hath given me understanding; my reins also have instructed me till the night season.
I beheld the Lord always before me, because He is at my right hand, that I be not moved.
Therefore my heart was glad, and my tongue rejoiced; my flesh also shall rest in hope.
For Thou wilt not leave my soul in Hades, neither wilt Thou suffer Thine Holy One to see corruption.
Thou hast made known to me the paths of life; with Thy presence shalt Thou fill me with joy; at Thy right hand there are delights for evermore.
Hear my right, O Lord; attend unto my supplication. Give ear unto my prayer, that goeth not out of feigned lips.
Let my judgment come forth from Thy presence; let mine eyes behold the things that are equal.
Thou hast proved mine heart; Thou hast visited it in the night; Thou hast tried me by fire, and unrighteousness hath not been found in me.
That my mouth may not speak the works of men, for the sake of the words of Thy lips have I kept hard ways.
Set Thou my goings in Thy paths, that my footsteps slip not.
I have cried, for Thou hast heard me, O God; incline Thine ear unto me, and hear my words.
Shew Thy marvellous mercies, O Thou that savest them which put their hope in Thee. From them that have resisted Thy right hand, keep me, O Lord, as the apple of Thine eye.
Thou wilt shelter me with the covert of Thy wings, from the face of the ungodly that have troubled me.
Mine enemies have compassed my soul; they are inclosed in their own fat, their mouth hath spoken proudly.
They cast me forth, and now have compassed me about; they have set their eyes bowing down to the earth.
They have taken me like as a lion that is ready for his prey, and as it were a young lion lurking in secret places.
Arise, O Lord, prevent them, and supplant them; deliver my soul from the ungodly, Thy sword from the enemies of Thine hand.
From Thy few of the earth, O Lord, do Thou separate them in their life; their belly is filled with Thy hid treasures.
They have satisfied themselves with swine, and have left the rest of their substance to their babes.
As for me, I shall appear before Thy face in righteousness; I shall be satisfied when Thy glory appeareth unto me.
I will love Thee, O Lord, my strength. The Lord is my firm support, and my refuge, and my deliverer.
My God is my helper, and in Him will I put my hope: my defender, and the horn of my salvation, and my helper.
I will call upon the name of the Lord with praise, and I shall be saved from mine enemies.
The pangs of death compassed me, and the floods of iniquity sore troubled me.
The pangs of Hades compassed me about; the snares of death prevented me.
And in mine affliction I called upon the Lord, and cried unto my God.
He heard my voice out of His holy temple, and my cry before Him shall come even into His ears.
And the earth shook and trembled, the foundations also of the mountains were troubled and were moved, because God was wroth with them.
There went up a smoke in His wrath, and fire from His countenance set all aflame; coals were kindled from it.
He bowed the heavens also, and came down, and thick darkness was under His feet.
And He ascended upon the cherubim, and did fly; yea, He did fly upon the wings of the wind.
And He made darkness His secret place, His tabernacle round about Him, dark water in the clouds of the air.
At the brightness that was before Him, the clouds passed; hail stones and coals of fire.
The Lord also thundered out of heaven, and the Highest gave His voice.
Yea, He sent out His arrows, and scattered them; and He multiplied lightnings, and discomfited them.
And the springs of waters were seen, and the foundations of the world were discovered, at Thy rebuke, O Lord, at the breath of the spirit of Thy wrath.
He sent from on high, and took me; He received me out of many waters.
He shall deliver me from my strong enemies, and from them which hate me, for they are too strong for me.
They prevented me in the day of my calamity, but the Lord was my stay.
He brought me forth also into refreshment; He will deliver me, because He delighted in me.
And the Lord shall reward me according to my righteousness, and according to the cleanness of my hands will He recompense me.
For I have kept the ways of the Lord, and have not done wickedly against my God.
For all His judgments are before me, and His statutes have not departed from me.
I will also be blameless with Him, and will keep myself from mine iniquity.
And the Lord shall recompense me according to my righteousness, and according to the cleanness of my hands in His eyesight.
With the holy Thou wilt be holy, and with the innocent man Thou wilt be innocent; and with the elect Thou wilt be elect, and with the froward Thou wilt be froward.
For Thou wilt save the humble people; and wilt bring down the eyes of the proud.
For Thou wilt light my lamp, O Lord my God; Thou wilt enlighten my darkness.
For by Thee I shall be delivered from a troop of thieves, and by my God shall I leap over a wall.
As for my God, His way is blameless; the words of the Lord are tried in the fire; He is the defender of all those that hope in Him.
For who is God, save the Lord? And who is God, save our God?
It is God that hath girded me with strength, and made my way blameless.
That maketh my feet like harts' feet, and setteth me upon high places.
He teacheth my hands to war; and Thou hast made mine arms as a bow of brass.
Thou hast also given me the shield of salvation, and Thy right hand hath holden me up.
And Thine instruction hath corrected me unto the end; Thine instruction it is that shall teach me.
Thou hast enlarged my steps under me, and my footsteps are not weakened.
I will pursue mine enemies, and overtake them; neither shall I turn again until they be consumed.
I will afflict them, and they shall not be able to rise; they shall fall under my feet.
For Thou hast girded me with strength unto war; Thou hast subdued under me those that rose up against me.
Thou hast also made mine enemies to turn their backs before me, and hast destroyed them that hated me.
They cried, but there was none to save them; even unto the Lord, but He heard them not.
And I will beat them small as the dust before the face of the wind; I will trample them down as the dirt in the streets.
Deliver me from the gainsaying of the people; Thou shalt make me the head of the heathen.
A people whom I have not known have served me; at the hearing of the ear they obeyed me.
The sons that are strangers lied unto me; the sons that are strangers waxed old, and halted from their paths.
The Lord liveth, and blessed be my God, and let the God of my salvation be exalted.
It is God that avengeth me, and hath subdued peoples under me; my deliverer from mine angry enemies.
Thou wilt lift me up above those that rise up against me; deliver me from the unrighteous man.
Therefore will I give thanks unto Thee, O Lord, among the heathen, and sing praises unto Thy name,
He magnifieth the salvation of His king, and worketh mercy for David His anointed, and for his seed for evermore.
The heavens declare the glory of God, and the firmament sheweth His handywork.
Day unto day uttereth speech, and night unto night sheweth knowledge.
There is no speech nor language, where their voices are not heard.
Their sound is gone out into all the earth, and their words to the ends of the world.
He hath set His tabernacle in the sun, and as a bridegroom coming out of his chamber,
He will rejoice as a giant to run his course. His going forth is from the end of heaven, and his circuit unto the end of it; and there is none that shall hide himself from the heat thereof.
The law of the Lord is blameless, converting souls; the testimony of the Lord is sure, giving wisdom to infants.
The statutes of the Lord are right, rejoicing the heart; the commandment of the Lord is bright, enlighteng the eyes.
The fear of the Lord is pure, enduring for ever and ever; the judgments of the Lord are true, justified altogether.
More to be desired are they than gold, yea, than much precious stone; sweeter also than honey and the honeycomb.
For Thy servant keepeth them; in keeping of them there is great reward.
Who will understand his transgressions? Cleanse Thou me from my secret faults, and from those of others spare Thy servant.
If they gain not dominion over me, then shall I be blameless, and cleansed of great sin.
And the words of my mouth shall be such as please, and the meditation of my heart shall be alway in Thy sight,
O Lord, my helper, and my redeemer.
The Lord hear Thee in the day of trouble; the name of the God
of Jacob defend Thee.
Send Thee help from the sanctuary, and help Thee out of Zion.
Remember all Thy sacrifices, and fatten Thy whole burntoffering.
The Lord grant Thee according to thine own heart, and fulfil all thy counsels.
We will rejoice in Thy salvation, and in the name of the Lord our God shall we be magnified.
The Lord fulfil all Thy petitions; now know I that the Lord hath saved His anointed.
He will hear him from His holy heaven; in mighty deeds is the salvation of His right hand.
Some trust in chariots, and some in horses, but we will call upon the name of the Lord our God.
They are bound, and are fallen, but we are risen, and set upright.
O Lord, save the king, and hear us in the day when we call upon Thee.
The king shall be glad in Thy strength, O Lord, and in Thy salvation greatly shall he rejoice.
Thou hast given him his heart's desire, and hast not withholden the requests of his lips.
For Thou hast prevented him with the blessings of goodness; Thou hast set a crown of precious stone upon his head.
He asked life of Thee, and Thou gavest him length of days for ever and ever.
His glory is great in Thy salvation; glory and majesty shalt Thou lay upon him.
For Thou shalt give him blessing for ever and ever; Thou shalt make him exceeding glad with Thy countenance.
For the king hopeth in the Lord, and through the mercy of the Most High he shall not be moved.
Let Thine hand be found on all Thine enemies; let Thy right hand find out all those that hate Thee.
For Thou shalt make them as a fiery oven in the time of Thy presence; the Lord shall trouble them in His wrath, and the fire shall devour them.
Their fruit shalt Thou destroy from the earth, and their seed from among the sons of men.
For they intended evils against Thee; they imagined counsels, which they shall not be able to establish.
For Thou shalt make them turn their back; Thou shalt make ready Thy countenance among them that are Thy remnant.
Be Thou exalted, Lord, in Thine own strength; we will sing and praise Thy mighty acts.
O God my God, look to me; why hast Thou forsaken me? Far from my salvation are the words of my transgressions.
O my God, I will cry in the daytime, but Thou wilt not hear; and in the night season, and it shall not be imputed unto folly in me.
But Thou dwellest in the holy place, O Thou praise of Israel. Our fathers hoped in Thee; they hoped, and Thou didst deliver them.
They cried unto Thee, and were saved; they hoped in Thee, and were not put to shame.
But I am a worm, and no man; a reproach of men, and the outcast of the people.
All they that saw me laughed me to scorn; they spake with their lips, they shook their heads, saying,
He hoped in the Lord, let Him deliver him; let Him save him, seeing He delighteth in him.
For Thou are He that took me out of the womb; my hope from my mother's breasts. I was cast upon Thee from the womb. Thou art my God from my mother's belly. Stand not aloof from me,
For trouble is near, for there is none to help me.
Many bullocks have compassed me; fat bulls have beset me round.
They opened their mouths against me, as a ravening and roaring lion.
I am poured out like water, and all my bones are scattered; my heart is become like wax melting in the midst of my bowels.
My strength is dried up like a potsherd, and my tongue hath cleaved to my throat; and Thou hast brought me down into the dust of death.
For many dogs have compassed me, and the assembly of the wicked hath inclosed me.
They pierced my hands and my feet, they told all my bones; and they looked and stared upon me.
They parted my garments among them, and cast lots upon my vesture.
But, remove not Thou Thy help far from me O Lord; look to my help.
Deliver my soul from the sword, mine only begotten one from the hand of the dog.
Save me from the lion's mouth, and my lowliness from the horns of unicorns.
I will declare Thy name unto my brethren; in the midst of the church will I sing praise unto Thee.
Ye that fear the Lord, praise Him; all ye the seed of Jacob, glorify Him.
Let all the seed of Israel fear Him.
For He hath not despised nor abhorred the supplication of the poor, neither hath He turned away His face from me; and when I cried to Him, He heard me.
My praise is of Thee; in the great congregation will I give thanks unto Thee; I will pay my vows before them that fear Thee.
The poor shall eat and be satisfied, and they shall praise the Lord that seek Him; their hearts shall live for ever and ever.
All the ends of the earth shall remember and turn unto the Lord, and all the kindreds of the nations shall worship before Him.
For the kingdom is the Lord's, and He is the governor of the nations.
All they that be fat upon the earth have eaten and worshipped; all they that go down to the dust shall fall down before Him.
Yea, my soul liveth to Him, and my seed shall serve Him.
The generation to come shall be told of the Lord, and they shall shew forth His righteousness unto a people that shall be born, which the Lord hath made.
The Lord is my shepherd, and I shall not want.
In a place of green pasture, there hath He made me to dwell; He hath nurtured me beside the water of rest.
He hath converted my soul; He hath led me in the paths of righteousness for His name's sake.
Yea, though I walk in the midst of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil; for Thou art with me.
Thy rod and Thy staff, they have comforted me.
Thou hast prepared a table before me, in the presence of them that trouble me.
Thou hast anointed my head with oil, and like the best wine doth Thy cup inebriate me.
And Thy mercy shall pursue me all the days of my life, and I will dwell in the house of the Lord unto length of days.
The earth is the Lord's, and the fulness thereof; the world, and all they that dwell therein.
He hath founded it upon the seas, and prepared it upon the rivers.
Who shall ascend into the mountain of the Lord, or who shall stand in His holy place?
He that is innocent in hands, and pure in heart, who hath not received his soul in vain, nor sworn deceitfully to his neighbour.
He shall receive a blessing from the Lord, and mercy from God his Saviour.
This is the generation of them that seek the Lord, that seek the face of the God of Jacob.
Lift up your gates, O ye princes, and be ye lifted up, ye everlasting gates; and the King of Glory shall come in.
Who is this King of Glory? the Lord strong and mighty, the Lord mighty in battle.
Lift up your gates, ye princes, and be ye lifted up, ye everlasting gates; and the King of Glory shall come in.
Who is this King of Glory? the Lord of hosts, He is the King of Glory.
Unto Thee, O Lord, have I lifted up my soul.
O my God, I have trusted in Thee, let me never be ashamed; neither let my enemies laugh me to scorn.
Yea, let none that wait on Thee be ashamed; let them be ashamed which transgress without cause.
Make Thy ways known to me, O Lord, and teach me Thy paths.
Guide me in Thy truth, and teach me, for Thou art God my Saviour; for on Thee have I waited all the day.
Remember, O Lord, Thy tender mercies, and Thy lovingkindnesses; for they are from everlasting.
Remember not the sins of my youth, nor mine ignorance; according to Thy mercy remember Thou me for Thy goodness' sake, O Lord.
Good and upright is the Lord; therefore He will give a law to sinners in the way.
The meek will He guide in judgment, and the meek will He teach his ways.
All the paths of the Lord are mercy and truth, unto such as seek His covenant and His testimonies.
For Thy name's sake, O Lord, be gracious unto my sin; for it is great.
What man is he that feareth the Lord? him shall He give a law in the way that He hath chosen.
His soul shall dwell among good things, and his seed shall inherit the earth.
The Lord is the strength of them that fear Him, and His covenant shall reveal it to them.
Mine eyes are ever toward the Lord; for He shall pluck my feet out of the snare.
Look Thou upon me, and have mercy upon me; for I am desolate and poor.
The troubles of my heart are multiplied; O bring Thou me out of my necessities.
Look upon my lowliness and my toil; and forgive all my sins.
Consider mine enemies, for they are multiplied; and they have hated me with unjust hatred.
O keep my soul, and deliver me; let me not be ashamed, for I have put my hope in Thee.
The innocent and the upright have cleaved to me; for I have waited on Thee, O Lord.
Redeem Israel, O God, out of all his troubles.
Judge me, O Lord, for I have walked in mine innocency; I have hoped also in the Lord, and shall not be weakened.
Prove me, Lord, and try me; try my reins and my heart with fire.
For Thy mercy is before mine eyes, and I have been well pleasing in Thy truth.
I have not sat with the council of vanity, neither will I go in with transgressors.
I have hated the congregation of evil doers, and will not sit with the ungodly.
I will wash my hands in innocency, and compass Thine altar, O Lord; that I may hear the voice of Thy praise, and tell of all Thy wondrous works.
Lord, I have loved the beauty of Thy house, and the place where Thy glory dwelleth.
Destroy not my soul with the ungodly, nor my life with men of blood, in whose hands are iniquities; their right hand is full of bribes.
But as for me, I have walked in mine innocency; redeem me, O Lord, and be merciful unto me.
My foot hath stood in uprightness; in the congregations will I bless Thee, O Lord.
The Lord is my light and my saviour; whom shall I fear? The Lord is the defender of my life; of whom shall I be afraid?
When the wicked drew nigh against me to eat up my flesh, even they that trouble me and are mine enemies, they were weakened, and fell.
Though an host should array itself against me, my heart shall not fear; though war should rise against me, in this have I hoped.
One thing have I desired of the Lord, this will I seek after; that I may dwell in the house of the Lord all the days of my life, to behold the delight of the Lord, and to visit His holy temple.
For in the day of my troubles He hid me in His tabernacle; in the secret of His tabernacle He sheltered me; He set me up upon a rock.
And now, behold, He hath lifted up my head above mine enemies.
I went round about, and offered in His tabernacle a sacrifice of praise and jubilation; I will sing, yea, I will sing praises unto the Lord.
Hear, O Lord, my voice, wherewith I have cried; have mercy upon me, and hear Thou me.
My heart hath said unto Thee, I will seek the Lord. My face hath sought Thee; Thy face, Lord, will I seek.
Turn not away Thy face from me, and turn not Thou away in anger from Thy servant.
Be Thou my help; cast me not away, neither forsake me, O God my Saviour.
For my father and my mother have forsaken me, but the Lord hath taken me to Himself.
Teach me Thy way, O Lord, and guide me in the right path, because of mine enemies.
Deliver me not over to the souls of them that trouble me; for unjust witnesses are risen up against me, and unrighteousness hath lied within itself.
I believe that I shall see the goodness of the Lord in the land of the living.
Wait on the Lord; be of good courage, and let thine heart be strengthened; and wait on the Lord.
Unto Thee will I cry, O Lord; O my God, be not silent to me, lest if Thou be silent to me, I become like them that go down into the pit.
Hear the voice of my supplication, O Lord, when I pray unto Thee, when I lift up my hands toward Thy holy temple.
Draw me not in with sinners, and destroy me not with the workers of unrighteousness,
Which speak peace to their neighbours; but mischief is in their hearts.
Give them, O Lord, according to their deeds, and according to the wickedness of their endeavours. Give them after the works of their hands; render to them their reward.
Because they have not hearkened to the works of the Lord, and the operations of His hands. Thou shalt destroy them, and not build them up.
Blessed be the Lord, because He hath heard the voice of my supplication.
The Lord is my help and my defender; my heart hoped in Him, and I am helped; and my flesh hath flourished anew, and willingly shall I praise Him.
The Lord is the strength of His people, and the defender of the salvation of His anointed.
Save Thy people, and bless Thine inheritance; shepherd them, and lift them up for ever.
Bring unto the Lord, O ye sons of God, bring unto the Lord young rams; bring unto the Lord glory and honour.
Bring unto the Lord the glory due unto His name; worship the Lord in His holy court.
The voice of the Lord is upon the waters; the God of glory hath thundered; the Lord is upon many waters.
The voice of the Lord is powerful; the voice of the Lord is full of majesty.
The voice of the Lord Which breaketh the cedars; yea, the Lord breaketh the cedars of Lebanon.
And He shall break them as small as a calf of Lebanon, and His beloved is like a young unicorn.
The voice of the Lord Which divideth the flame of fire.
The voice of the Lord Which shaketh the wilderness; yea, the Lord shall shake the wilderness of Kaddes.
The voice of the Lord gathereth the hinds, and will discover the thickets; and in His temple doth every one speak of His glory.
The Lord dwelleth in the flood; yea, the Lord shall sit as King for ever.
The Lord will give strength unto His people; the Lord will bless His people with peace.
I will exalt Thee, O Lord, for Thou hast lifted me up, and hast not made my foes to rejoice over me.
O Lord my God, I cried unto Thee; and Thou hast healed me.
O Lord, Thou hast brought up my soul from Hades; Thou hast saved me from them that go down to the pit.
Sing unto the Lord, O ye saints of His, and give thanks at the remembrance of His holiness.
For wrath is in His anger, but in His will is life; weeping may endure in the evening, but rejoicing cometh in the morning.
And in my prosperity I said, I shall never be moved.
Lord, by Thy favour Thou hast given strength unto my beauty; but Thou didst turn away Thy face, and I was troubled.
I will cry to Thee, O Lord, and unto my God will I make supplication.
What profit is there in my blood, when I go down to corruption?
Shall the dust praise Thee, or shall it declare Thy truth?
The Lord heard, and had mercy upon me; the Lord is become my helper.
Thou hast turned for me my mourning into joy; Thou hast rent off my sackcloth, and girded me with gladness;
To the end that my glory may sing praise to Thee, and that I be not pierced with sorrow. O Lord my God, I will give thanks unto Thee for ever.
In Thee, O Lord, have I put my hope, let me never be ashamed; deliver me in Thy righteousness, and rescue me.
Bow down Thine ear to me; rescue me speedily.
Be Thou unto me a defending God, and a house of refuge to save me.
For Thou art my strength and my refuge, and for Thy name's sake shalt Thou guide and nourish me.
Thou shalt bring me out of this snare that they have laid privily for me; for Thou, O Lord, art my defender.
Into Thy hands I will commit my spirit; Thou hast redeemed me, O Lord God of truth.
Thou hast hated them that idly hold to vanities; but I have hoped in the Lord.
I will rejoice and be glad in Thy mercy, for Thou hast considered my lowliness, Thou hast saved my soul out of adversities,
And hast not shut me up into the hand of the enemy; Thou hast set my feet in a large room.
Have mercy upon me, O Lord, for I am in trouble; mine eye is troubled with wrath, yea, my soul and my belly.
For my life is spent with grief, and my years with groanings; my strength is weakened through poverty, and my bones are troubled.
I am become a reproach among all mine enemies, but especially among my neighbours, and a fear to mine acquaintance. They that did see me without fled from me.
I am forgotten as a dead man out of mind; I am become like a broken vessel.
For I have heard the slander of many that dwell on every side; when they were assembled together against me, they devised to take away my life.
But I hoped in Thee, O Lord; I said, Thou art my God, my lots are in Thy hands.
Deliver me from the hand of mine enemies, and from them that persecute me.
Make Thy face to shine upon Thy servant; save me in Thy mercy.
Let me not be ashamed, O Lord, for I have called upon Thee; let the ungodly be ashamed, and brought down into Hades.
Let the lying lips be put to silence, which speak iniquity proudly and contemptuously against the righteous.
Oh how great is the multitude of Thy goodness, O Lord, which Thou hast laid up for them that fear Thee; which Thou hast wrought for them that hope in Thee before the sons of men!
Thou shalt hide them in the secret of Thy presence from the disturbance of men; Thou shalt shelter them in Thy tabernacle from the gainsaying of tongues.
Blessed be the Lord, for He hath marvellously shewed His mercy in a fortified city.
But I said in mine alarm, I am cut off from before Thine eyes; wherefore Thou heardest the voice of my supplication when I cried unto Thee.
O love the Lord, all ye His saints, for the Lord requireth truth, and rewardeth them that do exceeding proudly.
Be of good courage, and let your heart be strengthened, all ye that hope in the Lord.
Blessed are they whose iniquities are forgiven, and whose sins are covered.
Blessed is the man unto whom the Lord imputeth not sin, and in whose mouth there is no guile.
Because I kept silence, my bones waxed old through my crying all the day long.
For day and night Thy hand was heavy upon me; I was in misery while a thorn was stuck fast in me.
I acknowledged mine iniquity, and my sin have I not hid. said, I will confess against myself mine iniquity unto the Lord; and Thou forgavest the ungodliness of my heart.
For this shall every one that is godly pray unto Thee in a seasonable time; and in the flood of many waters they shall not come nigh unto Him.
Thou art my refuge from the trouble that surroundeth me; deliver me, O my joy, from them that have compassed me about.
I will instruct thee and guide thee in the way which thou shalt go; I will fix Mine eyes upon thee.
Be ye not as the horse, or as the mule, which have no understanding, whose jaws thou must hold in with bit and bridle, lest they come near unto thee.
Many are the scourges of the sinner, but he that hopeth in the Lord, mercy shall compass him about.
Be glad in the Lord, and rejoice, ye righteous; and glory, all ye that are upright in heart.
Rejoice in the Lord, O ye righteous; praise becometh the upright.
Praise the Lord with the harp; sing unto Him with the psaltery of ten strings.
Sing unto Him a new song; sing skilfully unto Him with jubilation.
For the word of the Lord is right, and all His works are done in faithfulness.
The Lord loveth mercy and judgment; the earth is full of the mercy of the Lord.
By the word of the Lord were the heavens established, and all the host of them by the breath of His mouth.
He gathereth the waters of the sea together as in a wineskin; He layeth up the depths in storehouses.
Let all the earth fear the Lord, and let all the inhabitants of the world be moved in awe of Him.
For He spake, and they were made; He commanded, and they were created.
The Lord scattereth the counsels of the heathen; He setteth aside the devices of the peoples, and maketh the counsels of princes of none effect.
But the counsel of the Lord standeth for ever, the thoughts of His heart from generation to generation.
Blessed is the nation whose God is the Lord, and the people whom He hath chosen for His Own inheritance.
The Lord looked down from heaven; He beheld all the sons of men.
From the place of His habitation that He prepared, He looked upon all the inhabitants of the earth.
He that fashioneth their hearts alone, that considereth all their works.
There is no king saved by much power, nor shall a mighty man be saved by the greatness of his strength.
A horse is a vain thing for safety, neither shall he be saved by the greatness of his strength.
Behold, the eyes of the Lord are upon them that fear Him, upon them that hope in His mercy;
To deliver their souls from death, and to nourish them in famine.
Our soul shall wait for the Lord, for He is our help and our defender.
For our heart shall be glad in Him, and we have hoped in His holy name.
Let Thy mercy, O Lord, be upon us, according as we have hoped in Thee.
I will bless the Lord at all times; His praise shall continually be in my mouth.
My soul shall be praised in the Lord; let the meek hear thereof, and be glad.
O magnify the Lord with me, and let us exalt His name for ever.
I sought the Lord, and He heard me, and delivered me from all my troubles.
O come unto him, and be lightened; and your faces shall not be ashamed.
This poor man cried, and the Lord heard him, and saved him out of all his troubles.
The angel of the Lord shall encamp round about them that fear Him, and shall deliver them.
O taste and see that the Lord is good; blessed is the man that hopeth in Him.
O fear the Lord, all ye His saints; for there is no want to them that fear Him.
The rich became poor, and suffered hunger; but they that seek the Lord shall not be deprived of any good thing.
Come, ye children, hearken unto me; I will teach you the fear of the Lord.
What man is he that desireth life, that loveth to see good days?
Keep thy tongue from evil, and thy lips from speaking guile.
Turn away from evil, and do good; seek peace, and pursue it.
The eyes of the Lord are upon the righteous, and His ears are open unto their supplication.
The face of the Lord is against them that do evil, to cut off the remembrance of them from the earth.
The righteous cried, and the Lord heard them, and delivered them out of all their troubles.
The Lord is nigh unto them that are of a contrite heart, and will save the humble of spirit.
Many are the afflictions of the righteous, but the Lord shall deliver them out of them all.
The Lord keepeth all their bones; not one of them shall be broken.
The death of the sinners is evil, and they that hate the righteous shall go astray.
The Lord shall redeem the souls of His servants, and none of them that hope in Him shall go astray.
Judge Thou, O Lord, them that do me injustice; fight against
them that fight against me.
Take hold of weapon and buckler, and rise up for mine help.
Draw out the sword, and stop the way against them that persecute me; say unto my soul, I am Thy salvation.
Let them be ashamed and confounded that seek after my soul; let them be turned back and put to shame that devise evil against me.
Let them become as chaff before the face of the wind, and let the angel of the Lord afflict them.
Let their way be dark and slippery, and let the angel of the Lord pursue them.
For without cause have they hid for me destruction in their snare; without cause have they reproached my soul.
Let a snare come upon him unawares, and let the snare that he hath hid catch himself; and into that very snare let him fall.
But my soul shall exult in the Lord; it shall delight in His salvation.
All my bones shall say, Lord, O Lord, who is like unto Thee, Which deliverest the poor from the hand of them that are too strong for him, yea, the poor and needy from them that spoil him?
Unjust witnesses did rise up; they charged me with things that I knew not.
They rewarded me evil for good, and barrenness to my soul.
But as for me, when they troubled me, I put on sackcloth, and humbled my soul with fasting; and my prayer shall return into mine own bosom.
I sought to please, as though it had been my neighbour or brother; I humbled myself, as one that is mourning and sad of countenance.
But they rejoiced against me, and gathered themselves together; plagues were gathered together upon me, and I knew it not. They were scattered, yet they were not pricked at the heart.
They tempted me, they scoffed at me with scorn, they gnashed upon me with their teeth.
Lord, when wilt Thou look upon me? Rescue my soul from their mischief, mine onlybegotten one from the lions.
I will give Thee thanks in the great congregation; I will praise Thee among a mighty people.
Let not them that are my enemies wrongfully rejoice over me, they that hate me without a cause, and wink with the eyes.
For they spake unto me peaceably indeed, but in their anger they devised deceits.
Yea, they opened their mouth wide against me; they said, Aha, aha, our eyes have seen it.
This Thou hast seen, O Lord, keep not silence; O Lord, be not far from me.
Arise, O Lord, and attend to my judgment, even unto my cause, my God and my Lord.
Judge me, O Lord, according to Thy righteousness; let them not rejoice over me, O Lord my God.
Let them not say in their hearts, Aha, aha, it is well to our soul; neither let them say, We have swallowed him up.
Let them be ashamed and brought to confusion together that rejoice at my woes. Let them be clothed with shame and confusion that speak great words against me.
Let them exult and be glad, that favour my righteous cause; yea, let them that desire the peace of Thy servant say continually, Let the Lord be magnified.
And my tongue shall speak of Thy righteousness, and of Thy praise all the day long.
The transgressor, that he may sin, saith within himself that there is no fear of God before his eyes.
For he hath dealt deceitfully with Him, lest he should find out his iniquity, and hate it.
The words of his mouth are iniquity and deceit; he hath not desired to know how to do good.
He hath devised iniquity upon his bed, he given himself to every way that is not good, and hath not abhorred evil.
Thy mercy, O Lord, is in the heavens, and Thy truth reacheth unto the clouds.
Thy righteousness is like the mountains of God; Thy judgments are a great deep. O Lord, Thou shalt preserve man and beast.
How hast Thou multiplied Thy mercy, O God! The sons of men shall put their hope in the shelter of Thy wings.
They shall be drunken with the fatness of Thy house, and Thou shalt make them drink of the torrent of Thy delight.
For with Thee is the fountain of life; in Thy light shall we see light.
O continue Thy mercy unto them that know Thee, and Thy righteousness to the upright in heart.
Let not the foot of pride come against me, and let not the hand of the wicked remove me.
There are all the workers of iniquity fallen; they are cast out, and shall not be able to stand.
Fret not thyself because of evildoers, neither be thou envious against the workers of iniquity.
For they shall soon be withered like the grass, and shall quickly fall away like the green herb.
Hope in the Lord, and do good, and dwell in the land; and thou shalt be fed with its riches.
Delight thyself in the Lord, and He shall give thee the desires of thy heart.
Disclose thy way unto the Lord, hope also in Him; and He shall bring it to pass.
And He shall bring forth thy righteousness as the light, and thy judgment as the noonday.
Submit thyself unto the Lord, and entreat thou Him; fret not thyself because of him who prospereth in his way, because of the man who worketh iniquity.
Cease from anger, and forsake wrath; fret not thyself to do evil.
For evildoers shall be cut off; but those that wait upon the Lord, they shall inherit the earth.
For yet a little while, and the sinner shall not be; yea, thou shalt seek his place, and shalt not find it.
But the meek shall inherit the earth, and shall delight themselves in the abundance of peace.
The sinner shall watch for the righteous, and gnash upon him with his teeth.
But the Lord shall laugh at him, for He seeth that his day is coming.
The sinners have drawn out the sword, they have bent their bow; to cast down the poor and needy, to slay such as be upright in heart.
Let their sword enter into their own heart, and let their bows be broken.
A little that the righteous man hath is better than the many riches of sinners.
For the arms of the sinners shall be broken, but the Lord upholdeth the righteous.
The Lord knoweth the ways of the blameless, and their inheritance shall be for ever.
They shall not be put to shame in an evil time, and in the days of famine they shall be satisfied.
For the sinners shall perish, and the enemies of the Lord, at the instant when they are glorified and exalted, vanish like smoke.
The sinner borroweth, and payeth not again; but the righteous sheweth mercy, and giveth.
For such as bless Him shall inherit the earth; but they that curse Him shall perish.
The steps of a man are ordered by the Lord, and He shall delight in his way.
When he falleth, he shall not be utterly cast down, for the Lord upholdeth his hand.
I have been young, and now am old; yet have I not seen the righteous forsaken, nor his seed begging bread.
The righteous is merciful, and lendeth all the day long, and his seed shall be blessed.
Depart from evil, and do good; and dwell for evermore.
For the Lord loveth judgment, and forsaketh not His saints; they shall be preserved for ever. But the trangressor shall be banished, and the seed of the ungodly shall be cut off.
The righteous shall inherit the land, and dwell therein for ever.
The mouth of the righteous shall meditate wisdom, and his tongue shall talk of judgment.
The law of his God is in his heart, and his steps shall not be tripped.
The sinner watcheth the righteous, and seeketh to slay him.
But the Lord will not leave him in his hands, nor condemn him when He judgeth him.
Wait on the Lord, and keep His way, and He shall exalt thee to inherit the land; when the wicked are cut off, thou shalt see it.
I have seen the ungodly highly exalted, and lifting himself up like the cedars of Lebanon.
Yet I passed by, and lo, he was not; yea, I sought him, but hisplace could not be found.
Keep innocency, and behold uprightness, for there is a remnant for the man of peace.
But the transgressors shall be destroyed together; the remnant of the ungodly shall perish.
But the salvation of the righteous is of the Lord, and He is their defender in the time of trouble.
And the Lord shall help them, and deliver them; and He shall rescue them from sinners, and save them, because they have hoped in Him.
O Lord, rebuke me not in Thy wrath, neither chasten me in Thine anger.
For Thine arrows are stuck fast in me, and Thou hast pressed Thine hand heavily upon me.
There is no soundness in my flesh because of Thine anger; neither is there any peace in my bones, because of my sins.
For mine iniquities are gone over my head; as an heavy burden have they pressed heavily upon me.
My wounds stink and are corrupt because of my foolishness.
I am become wretched and bowed down greatly; I went with mourning countenance all the day long.
For my loins are filled with mockings, and there is no soundness in my flesh.
I am troubled and humbled exceedingly; I have roared by reason of the groaning of my heart.
Lord, all my desire is before Thee, and my groaning is not hid from Thee.
My heart is troubled, my strength hath failed me; as for the light of my eyes, it also is not with me.
My friends and my neighbours drew near and stood against me, and my kinsmen stood afar off.
They also that sought after my soul used violence, and they that sought evils for me spake vanities, and imagined deceits all the day long.
But I, as a deaf man, heard not; and I was as a dumb man that openeth not his mouth.
And I was as a man that heareth not, and in whose mouth are no reproofs.
For in Thee, O Lord, have I hoped; Thou wilt hear me, O Lord my God.
For I said, Let never my enemies rejoice over me; for when my feet slipped, they magnify their words against me.
For I am ready for scourges, and my sorrow is continually before me.
For I will declare mine iniquity, and take thought for my sin.
But my enemies live, and are stronger than I, and they that hated me wrongfully are multiplied.
They that render me evil for good have slandered me, because I pursued the thing that good is.
Forsake me not, O Lord my God; depart not from me.
Give heed unto my help, O Lord of my salvation.
I said, I will take heed to my ways, lest I sin with my tongue. I set a guard for my mouth, while the sinner stood against me.
I was dumb, and humbled myself, and held my peace, even from good; and my sorrow was renewed.
My heart waxed hot within me, and while I was musing a fire was kindled. I spake with my tongue,
Lord, make me to know mine end, and the measure of my days, what it is; that I may know what I lack.
Behold, Thou hast made my days as an handbreadth, and my being is as nothing before Thee. Verily, all things are vanity, every man living.
Surely man walketh about as an image; he is disquieted in vain. He heapeth up riches, and knoweth not for whom he shall gather them.
And now what is my hope? is it not the Lord? Yea, my being is from Thee.
Deliver me from all my iniquities; Thou hast made me a reproach unto the foolish.
I was dumb, and opened not my mouth, because Thou hast made me.
Remove Thy scourges away from me, for I have fainted by the strength of Thine hand.
Thou with rebukes hast corrected man for iniquity, and hast made his life to consume away like a spider's web; surely every man disquieteth himself in vain.
Hear my prayer, O Lord, and my supplication; give ear unto my tears. Hold not Thy peace, for I am a sojourner with Thee, and a stranger, as all my fathers were.
O spare me, that I may be refreshed, before I go hence, and be no more.
I waited patiently for the Lord, and He inclined unto me, and heard my supplication.
He brought me up also out of the pit of misery, and out of the miry clay, and set my feet upon a rock, and directed my goings aright.
And He hath put a new song in my mouth, even a hymn unto our God. Many shall see it, and fear, and shall hope in the Lord.
Blessed is the man whose hope is in the name of the Lord, and regarded not vanities and false frenzies.
Many, O Lord my God, are Thy wonderful works which Thou hast done; and in Thy thoughts there is none that shall be likened to Thee. I declared and spake, They are multiplied beyond number.
Sacrifice and offering Thou didst not desire, but a body hast Thou perfected for me; whole burnt offerings and sin offerings hast Thou not required.
Then said I, Lo, I come; in the head of the book it is written of me,
That I should do Thy will, O my God; yea, Thy law is within my heart.
I have preached the good tidings of Thy righteousness in the great congregation. Lo, I will not refrain my lips, O Lord, Thou knowest.
I have not hid Thy righteousness within my heart; I have declared Thy truth and Thy salvation. I have not concealed Thy mercy and Thy truth from the great congregation.
But withhold not Thou Thy tender mercies from me, O Lord; let Thy mercy and Thy truth continually help me.
For innumerable evils have compassed me about; mine iniquities have taken hold upon me, and I am not able to see. They are multiplied more than the hairs of my head, and my heart hath
failed me.
Be pleased, O Lord, to deliver me; O Lord, look to helping me.
Let them be ashamed and confounded together that seek after my soul to destroy it. Let them be turned back and confounded that wish me evils.
Let them speedily receive shame for their reward that say unto me, Aha, aha!
Let all those that seek Thee rejoice and be glad in Thee, O Lord; and let such as love Thy salvation say continually, The Lord be magnified.
But I am poor and needy; the Lord will think upon me. Thou art my help and my defender, my God; make no tarrying.
Blessed is he that considereth the poor and needy; the Lord will deliver him in an evil day.
The Lord preserve him, and keep him alive, and make him blessed upon the earth, and deliver him not into the hands of his enemies.
The Lord help him upon his bed of pain; Thou hast turned all his bed in his sickness.
I said, Lord, be merciful unto me; heal my soul, for I have sinned against Thee.
Mine enemies spake evil against me: When shall he die, and his name perish?
And if he came to see me, his heart spake vanity; he gathered iniquity to himself; he went abroad, and spake in like manner.
All they that hate me whispered together against me; against me did they devise evils for me.
They set down a wicked word against me, saying, Shall he that sleepeth rise up again?
Yea, even the man of my peace, in whom I trusted, which did eat of my bread, hath lifted up his heel against me.
But Thou, O Lord, be merciful unto me, and raise me up; and I will requite them.
By this I know that Thou delightest in me, because mine enemy shall not rejoice over me.
And Thou hast holpen me because of mine innocency, and hast established me before Thy face for ever.
Blessed be the Lord God of Israel, from everlasting to everlasting. So be it. So be it.
As the hart panteth after the water springs, so panteth my soul after Thee, O God.
My soul hath thirsted for the mighty, the living God; when shall I come and appear before the face of God?
My tears have been my bread day and night, whilst it is said to me daily, Where is thy God?
I remembered these things, and poured out my soul in me; for I will go to the place of the wonderful tabernacle, even unto the house of God, with the voice of rejoicing and thanksgiving, the sound of those that keep holyday.
Why art thou cast down, O my soul, and why dost thou disquiet me? Hope thou in God, for I shall praise Him, the salvation of my countenance, and my God.
My soul hath been troubled within me; therefore will I remember Thee from the land of Jordan and Hermon, from the little mount.
Deep calleth unto deep at the voice of Thy cataracts; all Thy waves and Thy billows are gone over me.
The Lord will command His mercy in the daytime, and in the night a song to Him; with me is prayer unto the God of my life.
I will say unto God, Thou art my helper; why hast Thou forgotten me, and why go I mourning while mine enemy oppresseth me?
While my bones were broken, mine enemies reproached me, while they said daily unto me, Where is thy God?
Why art thou cast down, O my soul, and why dost thou disquiet me? Hope thou in God, for I will praise Him, Who is the salvation of my countenance, and my God.
Judge me, God, and give judgment in my cause against a nation that is not holy; deliver me from an unjust and deceitful man.
For Thou, O God, art my strength: why hast Thou cast me off, and why go I mourning while mine enemy oppresseth me?
O send out Thy light and Thy truth; they have led me, and brought me unto Thy holy mount, and to Thy tabernacles.
And I will go unto the altar of God, unto God Which giveth gladness to my youth; upon the harp will I praise Thee, O God, my God.
Why art thou cast down, O my soul, and why dost thou disquiet me? Hope thou in God, for I shall praise Him, the salvation of my countenance, and my God.
We have heard with our ears, O God, for our fathers have told us, what work Thou didst in their days, in the days of old.
Thine hand didst destroy the heathen, and Thou plantedst them in their stead; Thou didst bring evils upon those peoples, and cast them out.
For they got not the land in possession by their own sword, neither did their own arm save them.
But Thy right hand, and Thine arm, and the light of Thy countenance, because Thou hadst a favour unto them.
Thou art Thyself my King and my God, that commandest the salvation of Jacob.
Through Thee shall the horn of our strength push down our enemies, and through Thy name will we bring them to nought that rise up against us.
For I will not hope in my bow, neither shall my sword save me.
For Thou hast saved us from them that afflict us, and hast put them to shame that hated us.
In God shall we boast all the day long, and in Thy name shall we give praise for ever.
But now Thou hast cast us off, and put us to shame; and Thou, O God wilt not go forth with our armies.
Thou hast made us to turn back before our enemies, and they which hated us spoiled for themselves.
Thou hast given us like sheep appointed to be eaten, and hast scattered us among the heathen.
Thou hast sold Thy people for nought, and there was no profit in our selling.
Thou hast made us a reproach to our neighbours, a scorn and derision to them that are round about us.
Thou hast made us a byword among the heathen, a shaking of the head among the peoples.
All the day long my disgrace is before me, and the shame of my face hath covered me,
For the voice of him that reproacheth and revileth, by reason of the enemy and pursuer.
All this is come upon us, yet have we not forgotten Thee, neither have we dealt unrighteously in Thy covenant.
And our heart is not turned back, but Thou hast turned aside our paths from Thy ways.
For Thou hast humbled us in a place of affliction, and the shadow of death hath covered us.
If we have forgotten the name of our God, and if we have stretched out our hands to a strange god,
Shall not God search this out? for He knoweth the secrets of the heart.
For Thy sake are we killed all the day long; we are counted as sheep for the slaughter.
Awake, why sleepest Thou, O Lord? arise, and cast us not off for ever.
Wherefore turnest Thou Thy face away? forgettest Thou our poverty and affliction?
For our soul is brought down to the dust; our belly hath cleaved unto the earth.
Arise, O Lord, help us, and redeem us for Thy name's sake.
My heart hath uttered a good word; I speak of my works unto the king. My tongue is the pen of a ready writer.
Thou art fairer in beauty than the sons of men; grace is poured upon thy lips; therefore God hath blessed thee for ever.
Gird thy sword upon thy thigh, O thou mighty one, in thy comeliness and in thy beauty.
And bend thy bow, and prosper, and reign, because of truth and meekness and righteousness; and thy right hand shall lead thee wonderfully.
Thine arrows are sharp, O thou mighty one, in the heart of the king's enemies; peoples shall fall under thee.
Thy throne, O God, is for ever and ever; the sceptre of Thy kingdom is a sceptre of uprightness.
Thou lovest righteousness, and hatest iniquity; therefore God, thy God, hath anointed thee with the oil of gladness above thy fellows.
Myrrh, and aloes, and cassia are from thy garments, out of the ivory palaces, whereby they have made thee glad, kings' daughters in thine honour.
Upon thy right hand did stand the queen, robed in raiment of woven gold, adorned in divers colours.
Hearken, O daughter, and consider, and incline thine ear; forget also thine own people, and thy father's house.
And the king shall greatly desire thy beauty, for he is thy lord, and thou shalt worship him.
And the daughters of Tyre shall worship him with gifts; even the rich among the people shall entreat thy countenance.
All the glory of the king's daughter is from within; in goldfringed garments is she arrayed, adorned in colours.
The virgins that follow her shall be brought unto the king; those that are near to her shall be brought unto thee.
With gladness and rejoicing shall they be brought, they shall be brought into the king's temple.
Instead of thy fathers sons are born to thee; thou shalt make them princes over all the earth.
I will remember Thy name from generation to generation. Therefore shall the peoples praise Thee for ever, yea, for ever and ever.
God is our refuge and strength, a help in the troubles that come heavily upon us.
Therefore will not we fear when the earth is troubled, nor when the mountains are removed into the heart of the sea.
Their waters roared and were troubled; the mountains were troubled by His strength.
The streams of the river make glad the city of God; the Most High hath hallowed His tabernacle.
God is in the midst of her, she shall not be moved; God shall help her right early in the morning.
Nations were troubled, kingdoms trembled: the Most High uttered His voice; the earth was moved.
The Lord of hosts is with us; the God of Jacob is our helper.
Come and behold the works of God, what wonders He hath wrought upon the earth.
He maketh wars to cease unto the ends of the earth. He shall break the bow, and knap the weapon in sunder, and burn the shields with fire.
Be still, and know that I am God; I will be exalted among the heathen, I will be exalted in the earth.
The Lord of hosts is with us; the God of Jacob is our helper.
O clap your hands, all ye nations; shout unto God with a voice of rejoicing.
For the Lord Most High is terrible; He is a great King over all the earth.
He hath subdued the people under us, and the nations under our feet.
He hath chosen us for His inheritance, the beauty of Jacob which He loved.
God is gone up with jubilation, the Lord with the sound of the trumpet.
Sing praises to our God, sing praises; sing praises unto our King, sing praises.
For God is the king of all the earth; sing ye praises with understanding.
God reigneth over the heathen; God sitteth upon His holy throne.
The princes of the people are gathered together with the God of Abraham, for God's mighty ones of the earth are greatly exalted.
Great is the Lord, and greatly to be praised in the city of our God, in His holy mountain; well rooted, the joy of the whole earth,
On the mountains of Zion, on the sides of the north, is the city of the great king.
God is known in her palaces, when He cometh to her help.
For lo, the kings of the earth were assembled; they gathered together.
When they saw her so, they marvelled, they were troubled, they were moved; trembling took hold upon them; there were pains, as of a woman in travail.
With a vehement wind shalt Thou shatter the ships of Tarshish.
As we have heard, so have we seen, in the city of the Lord of hosts, in the city of our God.
God hath established it for ever.
We have thought of Thy mercy, O God, in the midst of Thy people.
According to Thy name, O God, so also is Thy praise unto the ends of the earth; Thy right hand is full of righteousness.
Let Mount Zion rejoice, and let the daughters of Judah be glad, because of Thy judgments, O Lord.
Walk about Zion, and go round about her; tell the towers thereof.
Mark ye well her strength in your hearts, and consider her bulwarks; that ye may tell it to another generation.
For this is our God for ever, yea, for ever and ever; He will shepherd us unto the ages.
Hear this, all ye nations; give ear, all ye inhabitants of the world.
All ye that are born of earth, and ye sons of men; rich and poor together.
My mouth shall speak of wisdom, and the meditation of my heart shall be of understanding.
I will incline my ear to a parable; I will open my dark saying upon the psaltery.
Wherefore should I fear in the day of evil? The iniquity at my heel shall compass me about.
There be some that trust in their strength, and boast themselves in the multitude of their riches.
A brother cannot redeem; shall a man redeem?
He shall not give to God a ransom for himself, nor the price of the redemption of his soul, even though he hath laboured for ever, and shall live unto the end.
For he shall not see corruption, when he seeth wise men dying.
The senseless and the fool shall perish together, and leave their wealth to others.
And their graves shall be their houses for ever, their dwelling places from generation to generation; though they have called their lands after their own names.
Nevertheless man being in honour understood not; he is compared to the senseless cattle, and is become like unto them.
This their way is a stumbling block for them, yet afterwards they shall please themselves with their mouth.
Like sheep they are laid in Hades; death shall be their shepherd.
And the upright shall have dominion over them in the morning, and their help shall wax old in Hades from their glory.
But God will redeem my soul from the hand of Hades, when He receiveth me.
Be not thou afraid when one is made rich, nor when the glory of his house is increased.
For when he dieth he shall carry nothing away; his glory shall not descend with him.
For in his life his soul shall be blessed; he will give Thee thanks when Thou doest well to him.
He shall go into the generation of his fathers; he shall never see light.
But man that is in honour, understood not; he is compared to the senseless cattle, and is become like unto them.
The God of gods, even the Lord, hath spoken, and called the
earth from the rising of the sun unto the going down thereof.
Out of Zion is the comeliness of His beauty.
God, our God, shall come manifestly, and shall not keep silence.
A fire shall burn before Him, and a mighty tempest shall be round about Him.
He shall summon the heaven above, and the earth, that He may judge His people.
Gather His saints together unto Him, those that have established His covenant upon sacrifices.
And the heavens shall declare His righteousness; for God is judge.
Hear, O My people, and I will speak to thee, O Israel; and I will testify against thee; I am God, even thy God.
I will not reprove thee for sacrifices, for thy whole burntofferings are continually before Me.
I will not welcome bullocks out of thy house, nor he goats out of thy flocks.
For all the beasts of the field are Mine, the cattle upon the mountains, and the oxen.
I know all the fowls of the air, and the beauty of the fields is Mine.
If I were hungry, I would not tell thee, for the world is Mine, and the fulness thereof.
Will I eat the flesh of bulls, or drink the blood of goats?
Offer unto God a sacrifice of praise, and pay thy vows unto the Most High.
And call upon me in the day of thy trouble, and I will deliver thee; and thou shalt glorify Me.
But unto the sinner God said, Why dost thou declare My statutes, and takest My covenant in thy mouth?
Thou hast hated instruction, and hast cast My words behind thee.
When thou sawest a thief, then thou didst run with him, and hast been partaker with the adulterer.
Thy mouth hath multiplied evil, and thy tongue hath framed deceits.
Thou satest and spakest against thy brother, and laidst a scandal against thy mother's son.
These things hast thou done, and I kept silence. Thou thoughtest wickedly that I should be like unto thee; but I will reprove thee, and set thy sins before thy face.
Now understand this, ye that forget God, lest He snatch you away, and there be none to deliver.
A sacrifice of praise shall glorify Me, and there is the way wherein I will shew him My salvation.
Have mercy upon me, O God, according to Thy great mercy; and according to the multitude of Thy tender mercies blot out my transgression.
Wash me thoroughly from mine iniquity, and cleanse me from my sin.
For I acknowledge my transgression, and my sin is ever before me.
Against Thee only have I sinned, and done this evil in Thy sight; that Thou mightest be justified in Thy words, and overcome when Thou art judged.
For behold, I was conceived in iniquities, and in sins did my mother bear me.
For behold, Thou hast loved truth; the hidden and secret things of Thy wisdom hast Thou revealed to me.
Thou shalt sprinkle me with hyssop, and I shall be cleansed; Thou shalt wash me, and I shall be made whiter than snow.
Thou shalt make me to hear joy and gladness; the bones that are humbled shall rejoice.
Turn away Thy face from my sins, and blot out all mine iniquities.
Create in me a clean heart, O God, and renew a right spirit within me.
Cast me not away from Thy presence, and take not Thy Holy Spirit from me.
Restore unto me the joy of Thy salvation, and stablish me with Thy sovereign Spirit.
I will teach transgressors Thy ways, and the ungodly shall turn again to Thee.
Deliver me from bloodguiltiness, O God, Thou God of my salvation; my tongue shall rejoice in Thy righteousness.
O Lord, Thou shalt open my lips, and my mouth shall shew forth Thy praise.
For hadst Thou desired sacrifice, I would have given it; Thou delightest not in whole burnt offerings.
A sacrifice to God is a contrite spirit; a contrite and humbled heart God will not despise.
Do good, O Lord, in Thy good pleasure unto Zion, and let the walls of Jerusalem be builded.
Then shalt Thou be pleased with the sacrifice of righteousness, oblation and whole burnt offerings.
Then shall they offer calves upon Thine altar.
Why boastest thou thyself in mischief, O mighty man, and in iniquity all the day long? Thy tongue hath devised unrighteousness; like a sharpened razor thou hast wrought deceit.
Thou hast loved evil more than good, and unrighteousness rather than to speak righteousness.
Thou hast loved all words of destruction, and a deceitful tongue.
Therefore God shall destroy thee for ever; He shall pluck thee out, and take thee away out of thy dwelling place, and thy root out of the land of the living.
The righteous shall see, and fear, and shall laugh at him, and say,
Lo, this is the man that made not God his helper, but trusted in the abundance of his riches, and strengthened himself in his vanity.
But I am like a fruitful olive tree in the house of God; I have hoped in the mercy of God for ever, and for ever.
I will praise Thee for ever, because Thou hast done it; and I will wait on Thy name, for it is good before Thy saints.
The fool hath said in his heart, There is no God. Corrupt are they, and are become abominable in iniquity; there is none that doeth good.
God looked down from heaven upon the sons of men, to see if there were any that did understand, or seek God.
They are all have gone astray, they are altogether become unprofitable; there is none that doeth good, no, not one.
Shall all the workers of iniquity have no knowledge, who eat up my people as they eat bread? They have not called upon the Lord.
There were they in great fear, where no fear was; for God hath scattered the bones of them that please men; they have been put to shame, because God hath despised them.
Who shall give the salvation of Israel out of Zion? When God turneth back the captivity of His people, Jacob shall rejoice, and Israel shall be glad.
Save me, O God, by Thy name, and judge me by Thy strength.
Hear my prayer, O God; give ear to the words of my mouth.
For strangers are risen up against me, and the mighty have sought after my soul; and they have not set God before them.
For behold, God helpeth me, and the Lord is the protector of my soul.
He shall bring evils upon my enemies; cut them off in Thy truth.
I will freely sacrifice unto Thee; I will praise Thy name, O Lord, for it is good.
For Thou hast delivered me out of every trouble, and mine eye hath looked down upon mine enemies.
Give ear to my prayer, O God, and despise not my supplication; attend unto me, and hear me.
I was grieved in my meditation, and was troubled, because of the voice of the enemy, and because of the oppression of the sinner.
For they brought iniquity upon me, and in wrath were they angry with me.
My heart is troubled within me, and the terror of death is fallen upon me.
Fearfulness and trembling are come upon me, and darkness hath covered me.
And I said, Who will give me wings like a dove? and I will fly away, and be at rest.
Lo, I fled afar off, and lodged in the wilderness.
I waited for God Which saveth me from faintheartedness and from tempest.
Drown, O Lord, and divide their tongues, for I have seen iniquity and strife in the city.
Day and night they go about it upon the walls thereof; iniquity and toil and unrighteousness are in the midst of it.
And usury and deceit have not departed from her streets.
For had an enemy reproached me, then I could have borne it; and if he that hated me had spoken great things against me, then I would have hid myself from him.
But it was thou, a man of like mind with me, my guide and my familiar friend.
Who sweetened my meals together with me; we walked in the house of God in company.
Let death come upon them, and let them go down quick into Hades; for wickedness is in their dwellings, and in the midst of them.
As for me, I cried unto God, and the Lord heard me.
Evening, and morning, and at noon will I declare and tell of it; and He shall hear my voice.
He shall redeem my soul in peace from them that draw near to me, for they among many were with me.
God shall hear, and bring them down, even He that abideth from everlasting.
For there is no change with them, for they have not feared God.
He hath put forth His hand to repay; they have defiled His covenant.
They were scattered at the wrath of His countenance, and their hearts have drawn near. Their words are smoother than oil, and yet are they very darts.
Cast thy care upon the Lord, and He shall nourish thee; He shall never suffer the righteous to be moved.
But Thou, O God, shalt bring these men down into the pit of destruction. Bloody and deceitful men shall not live out half their days; but I will trust in Thee, O Lord.
O Lord, our Hope, glory to Thee.
Be merciful unto me, O God, for man hath trod me down; he fighting all the day long hath oppressed me.
My enemies have trod me down all the day long, for they be many that fight against me from on high.
By day I will not be afraid, but I will hope in Thee.
In God I will praise my words, in God I have put my hope; I will not fear what flesh can do unto me.
All the day long they abhorred my words; all their thoughts were against me for evil.
They will dwell near, and hide themselves; they will mark where I set my heel, as they have waited for my soul.
By no means shalt Thou save them; in wrath shalt Thou cast down the peoples, O God.
I have declared my life unto Thee; Thou hast set my tears in Thy sight.
As also in Thy promise, shall mine enemies be turned back. In whatsoever day I call upon Thee, behold, I know that Thou art my God.
In God will I praise His word; in the Lord will I praise His speech.
In God have I put my hope; I will not be afraid what man can do unto me.
Thy vows are upon me, O God, which I will render in praise of Thee.
For Thou hast delivered my soul from death, mine eyes from tears, and my feet from sliding; that I may be pleasing before the Lord in the light of the living.
Be merciful unto me, O God, be merciful unto me; for my soul trusteth in Thee. Yea, in the shadow of Thy wings will I put my hope, until iniquity be overpast.
I will cry unto God Most High, unto God my benefactor.
He hath sent from heaven, and saved me; He hath made them a reproach that trod me down.
God hath sent His mercy and His truth, and hath delivered my soul from the midst of lions' whelps; I slept, troubled.
The sons of men, their teeth are weapons and arrows, and their tongue a sharp sword.
Be Thou exalted, O God, above the heavens, and Thy glory above all the earth.
They have prepared a snare for my feet, and bowed down my soul. They have digged a pit before me, and they are fallen into it themselves.
My heart is ready, O God, my heart is ready; I will sing and give praise in my glory.
Awake up, my glory; awake, psaltery and harp; I myself will awake right early.
I will praise Thee, O Lord, among the peoples; I will sing praise unto Thee among the nations.
For Thy mercy is magnified unto the heavens, and Thy truth unto the clouds.
Be Thou exalted, O Lord, above the heavens, and Thy glory above all the earth.
If ye do indeed speak righteousness, judge rightly, O ye sons of men.
Yea, in your heart ye work wickedness in the earth; your hands devise unrighteousness.
Sinners are estranged from the womb; they have gone astray even from the belly, they have spoken lies.
Their rage is like that of a serpent, like the asp that is deaf, and stoppeth her ears.
Which will not hearken to the voice of charmers, nor heed the charm prepared skilfully by the wise.
God shall crush their teeth in their mouth; the Lord hath shattered the great teeth of the lions.
They shall come to nought as waters running down; He shall bend his bow until they be weakened.
Like wax that is melted, they shall be taken away; fire hath fallen upon them, and they have not seen the sun.
Before your thorns can know the briar, He shall swallow them up living in His wrath.
The righteous shall rejoice when he seeth the vengeance; he shall wash his hands in the blood of the sinner.
And man shall say, If indeed there be fruit for the righteous, verily there is a God that judgeth them upon the earth.
Rescue me from mine enemies, O God, and redeem me from them that rise up against me.
Deliver me from the workers of iniquity, and save me from men of blood.
For lo, they have hunted after my soul, the mighty have set upon me; not for mine iniquity, nor for my sin, O Lord.
I ran and directed my steps without iniquity; arise to meet me, and behold.
And Thou, O Lord God of hosts, the God of Israel, look to visit all the heathen; be not merciful to any that work iniquity.
They shall return at evening, and hunger like dogs, and go round about the city.
Behold, they shall utter a sound with their mouth, and a sword is in their lips: For who, say they, hath heard us?
But Thou, O Lord, shalt laugh at them; Thou shalt bring all the nations to nought.
O my strength, I will keep watch for Thee; for Thou, O God, art my helper.
As for my God, His mercy shall prevent me; God shall reveal it unto me among mine enemies.
Slay them not, lest at any time they forget Thy law: scatter them by Thy power, and bring them down, O Lord my defender.
For the sin of their mouth and the words of their lips, let them be taken captive in their pride.
And for their cursing and lying shall their utter destruction be made known, in the wrath of utter destruction.
And they shall be no more, and they shall know that God is Lord of Jacob, and of the ends of the earth.
They shall return at evening, and hunger like dogs, and go round about the city.
They shall be scattered abroad to eat; they shall murmur if they be not satisfied.
But I will sing of Thy power; yea, I will rejoice in Thy mercy in the morning. For Thou art become my helper and my refuge in the day of my trouble.
Thou art my helper, unto Thee will I sing, for Thou, O God, art my helper; my God, Thou art my mercy.
O God, Thou hast cast us off, and hast destroyed us; Thou hast been angry, and hast had pity upon us.
Thou hast made the earth to tremble, and hast troubled it; heal the breaches thereof, for it hath been shaken.
Thou hast shewed Thy people hard things; Thou hast made us drink the wine of sorrow.
Thou hast given a sign to them that fear Thee, that they may flee from before the bow.
That Thy beloved may be delivered, save with Thy right hand, and hear me.
God hath spoken in His holiness, I will exult, and divide Shechem, and measure out the vale of tabernacles.
Gilead is Mine, and Manasseh is Mine; Ephraim also is the strength of My head; Judah is My king.
Moab is the caldron of My hope, over Edom will I stretch forth My shoe; the strangers are made subject unto Me.
Who will lead me into a fortified city? Or who will bring me into Edom?
Will not Thou, O God, Who hast cast us off? And wilt not Thou, O God, go forth with our armies?
Give us help from trouble, for vain is the salvation of man.
Through God we shall do mightily, and He shall bring those that afflict us to nought.
Hear my supplication, O God; attend unto my prayer.
From the ends of the earth have I cried unto Thee, when my heart was in anguish; Thou hast lifted me high upon a rock.
Thou hast guided me, for Thou hast been my hope, a strong tower against the face of the enemy.
I will abide in Thy tabernacle for ever; I shall be sheltered under the covert of Thy wings.
For Thou, O God, hast heard my prayers; Thou hast given an heritage unto them that fear Thy name.
Thou wilt add days to days of the king, his years even to generation upon generation.
He shall abide before the face of God for ever; who shall search out His mercy and truth?
So will I sing praise unto Thy name for ever and ever, that I may daily perform my vows.
Shall not my soul be subject unto God? for from Him cometh my salvation.
For He is my God, my Saviour and my helper; and I shall be moved no more.
How long do ye assail a man? Ye slay, all of you, as a leaning wall, and a tottering fence.
But they consulted to cast down my honour; they ran in lies; they bless with their mouth, but curse in their heart.
But my soul, be thou subject unto God; for my endurance is from Him.
For He Himself is my God, and my Saviour; He is my helper; and I shall not be moved.
In God is my salvation and my glory; He is the God of my help, and my hope is in God.
Hope in Him, all ye congregation of the peoples; pour out your hearts before Him, for God is our helper.
For the sons of men are vain, the sons of men are liars in the balances; out of vanity they gather themselves together, that they may work injustice.
Hope not in injustice, and covet not plunder; if riches flow in, set not your heart upon them.
God hath spoken once, and these two things have I heard: that power belongeth unto God; also unto Thee belongeth mercy, O Lord; for Thou shalt render unto every man according to his works.
O God my God, early do I rise to Thee. My soul hath thirsted for Thee; how many ways hath my flesh longed after Thee, in a barren and untrodden land, where no water is.
Thus have I appeared before Thee in the sanctuary, that I might see Thy power and Thy glory.
Because Thy mercy is better than life; my lips shall praise Thee.
Thus will I bless Thee while I live, and will lift up my hands in Thy name.
Let my soul be satisfied as with marrow and fatness, and my mouth shall praise Thee with joyful lips.
If I remembered Thee upon my bed, I meditated on Thee in the morning watches.
Because Thou hast been my help; in the shelter of Thy wings will I rejoice.
My soul hath cleaved unto Thee; Thy right hand hath upheld me.
But they have sought my soul in vain; they shall go into the lower parts of the earth; they shall be given over to the power of the sword; they shall be portions for foxes.
But the king shall be glad in God; every one that sweareth by Him shall be praised; for the mouth of them that speak unjust things is stopped.
Hear my prayer, O God, when I make supplication unto Thee; rescue my soul from fear of the enemy.
Shelter me from the assembly of the wicked, from the multitude of the workers of unrighteousness.
They have whetted their tongues like a sword, they have bent their bow, a bitter thing, that they may shoot in secret at the blameless.
Suddenly will they will shoot at him, and will not fear; they have strengthened themselves with a wicked word.
They have communed of laying snares privily; they said, Who shall see them?
They searched out iniquity; they wearied themselves with a diligent search.
A man shall draw near, and the heart is deep; and God shall be exalted.
As an arrow of babes are their blows, and their tongues were weakened against them.
All that saw them were troubled, and every man feared.
And they declared the works of God, and understood His doings.
The righteous shall be glad in the Lord, and shall hope in Him, and all the upright in heart shall be praised.
Unto Thee, O God, belongeth praise in Zion, and unto Thee
shall the vow be performed in Jerusalem.
Hear my prayer; unto Thee shall all flesh come.
The words of transgressors have overpowered us, but Thou shalt be merciful to our ungodliness.
Blessed is he whom Thou hast chosen, and taken unto Thee; he shall dwell in Thy courts.
We shall be filled with the good things of Thy house; holy is Thy temple, wonderful in righteousness.
Hearken unto us, O God our Saviour, Thou hope of all the ends of the earth and of them that are afar off upon the sea.
Who by Thy strength settest fast the mountains, being girded about with power; Who troublest the depths of the sea: who shall withstand the noise of its waves?
The nations shall be troubled, they also that dwell in the uttermost parts shall be afraid at Thy tokens; Thou shalt make the outgoings of the morning and evening to rejoice.
Thou hast visited the earth, and watered it plenteously; Thou hast greatly enriched it.
The river of God is full of waters; Thou hast prepared their food, for so is its preparation.
Make Thou her furrows drunk with water, multiply her fruits; when she springeth up she will rejoice in her showers.
Thou shalt bless the crown of the year of Thy goodness, and Thy plains shall be filled with fatness.
The mountains of the wilderness shall be enriched, and the hills shall be girded about with exultation.
The rams of the flock are clothed in fleece, and the valleys shall abound with corn; they shall cry aloud, yea, they shall sing hymns.
Shout with jubilation unto the Lord, all the earth.
Sing praises unto His name, give glory in His praise.
Say unto God, How terrible are Thy works! In the greatness of Thy power shall Thine enemies be found liars unto Thee.
Let all the earth worship Thee, and sing praises unto Thee; let them sing praises unto Thy name, O Thou Most High.
Come and see the works of God, how terrible He is in His counsels over the sons of men.
He turneth the sea into dry land; they shall go through the river on foot; there shall we be glad in Him,
Which ruleth by His power for ever. His eyes behold the nations; let not them that embitter Him be exalted in themselves.
O bless our God, ye nations, and make the voice of His praise to be heard,
Which holdeth my soul in life, and suffereth not my feet to be moved.
For Thou, O God, hast proved us, and hast tried us by fire, as silver is tried.
Thou broughtest us into the snare, Thou laidst afflictions upon our back.
Thou didst set men over our heads; we went through fire and water; but Thou broughtest us out into refreshment.
I will go into Thy house with an whole burnt offering; I will pay Thee my vows, which my lips have uttered, and my mouth hath spoken, when I was in trouble.
I will offer unto Thee whole burnt offerings, full of marrow, with the incense of rams; I will offer unto Thee oxen with goats.
Come and hear, all ye that fear God, and I will declare what He hath done for my soul.
I cried unto Him with my mouth, and extolled Him with my tongue.
If I have regarded unrighteousness in my heart, let not the Lord hear me.
Wherefore God hath heard me; He hath attended to the voice of my prayer.
Blessed be God, Which hath not turned away my prayer, nor His mercy from me.
God be gracious unto us, and bless us, and cause His face to shine upon us, and have mercy upon us.
That we may know Thy way upon earth, Thy salvation among all nations.
Let the peoples praise Thee, O God; let all the peoples praise Thee.
O let the nations be glad and rejoice, for Thou shalt judge the peoples with uprightness, and guide the nations upon earth.
Let the peoples praise Thee, O God, let all the peoples praise Thee;
The earth hath yielded her increase. Let God, even our own God, bless us.
Let God bless us, and let all the ends of the earth fear Him.
Let God arise, and let His enemies be scattered; let them also that hate Him flee from before His face.
As smoke vanisheth, so let them vanish away; as wax melteth before the fire, so let sinners perish at the presence of God.
But let the righteous be glad; let them rejoice before God; let them delight with gladness.
Sing unto God, sing praises to His name; prepare the way for Him that rideth upon the setting of the sun. The Lord is His name; yea, rejoice before Him.
Let them be troubled at the presence of Him that is a father of the fatherless, and a judge for the widows: even God in His holy place.
God settleth the solitary in a house; He bringeth out with might those which were imprisoned; yea, likewise them that embitter Him, that dwell in sepulchres.
O God, when Thou wentest forth before Thy people, when Thou didst pass through the wilderness,
The earth shook, the heavens also dropped dew at the presence of the God of Sinai, at the presence of the God of Israel.
Thou, O God, shalt ordain a gracious rain for Thine inheritance; yea, it was weary, but Thou shalt restore it.
Thy creatures shall dwell therein; Thou, O God, hast provided of Thy goodness for the poor.
The Lord shall give the word to them that preach good tidings with great power.
The king of the hosts of his beloved shall divide the spoils for the beauty of the house.
Though ye sleep among the lots, yet shall ye have the wings of a dove covered with silver, and her pinions with yellow gold.
When He that is in heaven appointeth kings over her, they shall be white as snow in Salmon.
The mountain of God is a rich mountain, a curdled mountain, a rich mountain.
Wherefore do ye suppose that there be other curdled mountains? This is the mountain wherein God is well pleased to dwell; yea, the Lord will dwell in it for ever.
The chariots of God are ten thousands, yea, thousands of them abounding; the Lord is among them in Sinai, in His holy place.
Thou hast ascended on high, Thou hast led captivity captive; Thou hast received gifts among men, yea, though they were rebellious, that Thou mightest dwell therein.
Blessed be the Lord, blessed be the Lord day by day; the God of our salvation shall prosper us along the way.
Our God is the God of salvation, and of the Lord, the Lord, are the issues of death.
But God shall crush the heads of His enemies, the hairy crown of them that go on in their trespasses.
The Lord said, I will bring again from Bashan, I will bring My people again through the depths of the sea,
That thy foot may be dipped in blood, and the tongue of thy dogs in that of thine enemies.
Thy goings have been seen, O God, the goings of my God, of my King in His sanctuary.
The princes went before, and after them the singers, in the midst of damsels playing with timbrels.
Bless ye God in the congregations, even the Lord, from the fountains of Israel.
There is Benjamin the younger, in ecstasy; the princes of Judah their rulers; the princes of Zebulun; the princes of Naphtali.
Command Thy power, O God; strengthen, O God, that which Thou hast wrought in us.
Because of Thy temple at Jerusalem shall kings bring presents unto Thee.
Rebuke the wild beasts of the reeds, the congregation of bulls among the heifers of the peoples, lest they shut them out that have been tried like silver. Scatter Thou the peoples that delight in war.
Ambassadors shall come out of Egypt; Ethiopia shall hasten to stretch out her hands unto God.
Sing unto God, ye kingdoms of the earth; O sing praises unto the Lord, to Him that rideth upon the heaven of heavens toward the dayspring. Lo, He will give to His voice a voice of power.
Ascribe ye glory unto God; His magnificence is over Israel, and His strength is in the clouds.
God is wonderful in His saints; the God of Israel is He that will give power and strength unto His people. Blessed be God.
Save me, O God, for the waters are come in unto my soul. am stuck fast in the deep mire, and there is no sure standing. I am
come into the deeps of the sea, and a tempest hath overwhelmed me.
I am weary of my crying, my throat is become hoarse, my eyes have failed from hoping in my God.
They that hate me without a cause are multiplied more than the hairs of my head; mine enemies are grown strong that persecute me unjustly; then I restored that which I took not away.
O God, Thou knowest my foolishness, and my trespasses are not hid from Thee.
Let not those that wait on Thee, O Lord, Thou Lord of hosts, be ashamed for my sake; nor let them that seek Thee be confounded for my sake, O God of Israel.
Because for Thy sake I have borne reproach; shame hath covered my face.
I am become a stranger unto my brethren, and an alien unto my mother's sons.
For the zeal of Thine house hath eaten me up, and the reproaches of them that reproach Thee are fallen upon me.
And I covered my soul with fasting, and that was made a reproach unto me.
I made sackcloth also my garment, and I became a byword unto them.
They that sit in the gate spake against me, and they that drink wine made me their song.
But as for me, with my prayer will I cry unto Thee, O Lord, at the time of Thy good pleasure. O God, in the multitude of Thy mercy hear me, in the truth of Thy salvation.
Save me from the mire, that I may not stick fast; let me be delivered from them that hate me, and out of the deep waters.
Let not the waterflood overwhelm me, neither let the deep swallow me up, and let not the pit shut her mouth upon me.
Hear me, O Lord, for Thy mercy is good; look upon me according to the multitude of Thy tender mercies.
Turn not Thy face away from Thy servant, for I am in trouble; hear me speedily.
Draw nigh unto my soul, and redeem it; deliver me because of mine enemies.
For Thou knowest my reproach, and my shame, and my dishonour. All they that trouble me are before Thee.
My soul hath expected eproach and misery; and I looked for one that would grieve with me, but there was none; and for one that would comfort me, but found I none.
They gave me also gall for my meat, and for my thirst they gave me vinegar to drink.
Let their table become a snare before them, for a recompense, and for a stumbling block.
Let their eyes be darkened, that they see not, and bow down their back continually.
Pour out Thy wrath upon them, and let Thy wrathful anger take hold of them.
Let their habitation be made desolate, and let none dwell in their tents.
For they persecuted him whom Thou hast smitten, and they have added to the pain of my wounds.
Add iniquity unto their iniquity, and let them not come into Thy righteousness.
Let them be blotted out of the book of the living, and not be written with the righteous.
I am poor and sorrowful; let Thy salvation, O God, be quick to help me.
I will praise the name of my God with a song; I will magnify Him with praise.
And this shall please God better than a young calf that hath horns and hoofs.
Let the needy see this, and be glad; seek ye God, and your soul shall live.
For the Lord hath heard the poor, and hath not despised His prisoners.
Let the heavens and the earth praise Him; the sea and every thing that creepeth therein.
For God will save Zion, and the cities of Judah shall be built up; and they shall dwell there, and inherit it.
The seed also of Thy servants shall possess it, and they that love Thy name shall dwell therein.
O God, attend to help me; make haste to help me, O Lord.
Let them be ashamed and confounded that seek after my soul; let them be turned backward and put to shame that wish me evils.
Let them forthwith be turned back ashamed that say unto me, Aha, aha.
Let all those that seek Thee, O God, rejoice and be glad in Thee; and let such as love Thy salvation say continually, Let the Lord be magnified.
But I am poor and needy; help me, O God. Thou art my help and my deliverer; O Lord, make no tarrying.
In Thee, O Lord, have I put my hope; let me never be put to shame. Deliver me in Thy righteousness, and rescue me; incline Thine ear unto me, and save me.
Be Thou unto me a defending God, and stronghold to save me, for Thou art my firm support and my refuge.
Deliver me, O my God, out of the hand of the sinner, out of the hand of the transgressor and unrighteous man.
For Thou art mine endurance, O Lord; O Lord, Thou art my hope from my youth.
On Thee have I been holden up from the womb; from my mother's belly Thou art my protector. My song of praise is continually of Thee.
I am become as a wonder unto many, but Thou art my strong helper.
Let my mouth be filled with Thy praise, that I may hymn Thy glory and majesty all the day long.
Cast me not off in the time of old age; forsake me not when my strength faileth.
For my enemies spake against me, and they that lay wait for my soul took counsel together,
Saying, God hath forsaken him; persecute and take him, for there is none to deliver him.
My God, be not far from me; O my God, attend unto my help.
Let them be ashamed and brought to nought that slander my soul; let them be covered with shame and confusion that seek evils for me.
But I will hope in Thee continually, and will add to all Thy praise.
My mouth shall shew forth Thy righteousness, Thy salvation all the day; for I know not the reckoning thereof.
I will go in the strength of the Lord; O Lord, I will make mention of Thy righteousness, which is Thine alone.
O God, Thou hast taught me from my youth; and until now will I declare Thy wondrous works.
Yea, unto old age and gray hairs, my God, forsake me not; until I have shewed Thy mighty arm to every generation that is to come,
Thy power and Thy righteousness, O God, and even to the highest the great things which Thou hast done. O God, who is like unto Thee?
How great are the troubles which Thou hast shewed me, many and evil; yet Thou hast turned and quickened me, and hast brought me up again from the depths of the earth.
Thou hast multiplied Thy magnificence over me, and Thou hast turned and comforted me, and hast brought me up again from the depths of the earth.
My lips shall greatly rejoice when I sing unto Thee, and my soul, which Thou hast redeemed.
My tongue also shall meditate on Thy righteousness all the day long, when they are brought to shame, and confounded, that seek evils for me.
Give the king Thy judgment, O Lord, and Thy righteousness unto the king's son.
That he may judge Thy people with righteousness, and Thy poor with judgment.
Let the mountains receive peace for the people, and the hills righteousness.
He shall judge the poor of the people, and shall save the children of the needy, and shall humble the false accuser.
And He shall continue as long as the sun, and before the moon, from generation to generation.
He shall come down like rain upon a fleece, and as raindrops that fall upon the earth.
In His days shall righteousness spring up, and abundance of peace, until the moon be taken away.
He shall have dominion also from sea to sea, and from the rivers unto the ends of the earth.
The Ethiopians shall fall down before Him, and His enemies shall lick the dust.
The kings of Tarshish and of the isles shall bring presents; the kings of the Arabians and of Sheba shall offer gifts.
Yea, all the kings of the earth shall worship Him; all nations shall serve Him.
For He hath delivered the needy from the oppressor, the poor also that had no helper.
He shall spare the poor and needy, and shall save the souls of the needy.
He shall redeem their souls from usury and injustice, and precious shall His name be in their sight.
And He shall live, and to Him shall be given of the gold of Arabia; they and shall pray concerning Him continually; all the day long shall they bless Him.
He shall be a firmament in the earth, upon the tops of the mountains; the fruit thereof shall be exalted above Lebanon, and they of the city shall flourish like grass of the earth.
His name shall be blessed unto the ages; His name continueth before the sun. And in Him shall all the tribes of the earth be blessed; all nations shall call Him blessed.
Blessed be the Lord God of Israel, who only doeth wondrous things.
And blessed be the name of His glory for ever, yea, for ever and ever.
And all the earth shall be filled with His glory. So be it. So be it.
The praises of David the son of Jesse are ended.
How good is God to Israel, even to such as are of an upright heart.
But as for me, my feet were almost gone, my steps had well nigh slipped.
Because I was envious at the transgressors, when I saw the peace of sinners.
For they show no refusal in their death, and they are steadfast in their stripes.
They are not in labours as other men, neither shall they be scourged with other men.
Therefore their pride hath held them fast; they have covered themselves with their injustice and ungodliness.
Their injustice shall go forth, as out of fatness; they have come into their heart's desire.
They have thought and spoken wickedly; they have spoken unrighteousness loftily.
They have set their mouth against heaven, and their tongue walketh through the earth.
Therefore shall my people return hither, and full days shall be found in them.
And they said, How doth God know? and is there knowledge in the Most High?
Behold, these are the sinners; they prosper in this age, and have obtained riches.
And I said, Verily I have justified my heart in vain, and washed my hands in innocency.
For all the day long have I been as a man scourged, and reproof was mine every morning.
If I said, I will speak thus, behold, I had broken covenant with the generation of Thy children.
And I sought to know this, but it is a labour in my sight.
Until I come into the sanctuary of God, and understand their end.
Verily Thou hast appointed evils for them for their crafty dealings; Thou castedst them down when they were lifted up.
How are they brought to desolation in a moment! They are consumed; they have perished because of their iniquity.
As a dream of one that awaketh, O Lord, so in Thy city shalt Thou despise their image.
For my heart was on fire, and my reins were changed.
And I was brought to nothing, and I knew it not. I became as a beast before Thee, yet I am always with Thee.
Thou hast holden me by my right hand, and hast guided me with Thy counsel, and received me with glory.
For what have I in heaven, and what have I desired upon the earth beside Thee?
My heart and my flesh have failed, O Thou God of my heart; but God is my portion for ever.
For lo, they that go afar from Thee shall perish; Thou hast destroyed all them that go a whoring from Thee.
But it is good for me to cleave unto God, to put my hope in the Lord, that I may declare all Thy praises in the gates of the daughter of Zion.
O God, why hast Thou cast us off for ever? Why hath Thine anger raged against the sheep of Thy pasture?
Remember Thy congregation, which Thou hast purchased from the beginning.
Thou hast redeemed the rod of Thine inheritance, this Mount Zion wherein Thou hast dwelt.
Lift up Thy hands against their perpetual pride, against all that the enemy hath done wickedly in Thy sanctuary.
And they that hate Thee have made their boast in the midst of Thy feast.
They set up their ensigns for signs, though they knew it not, in the entrances on high.
As in a forest of trees, they have cut down at once the doors thereof with axes; they have broken it down with axe and hammer.
With fire have they burned down Thy sanctuary; they have defiled the dwelling place of Thy name to the ground.
They said in their heart, the whole kindred of them together, Come, let us abolish all the feasts of God from the earth.
We have not seen our signs, there is no more any prophet; and He will know us no more.
O God, how long shall the enemy reproach? shall the enemy provoke Thy name for ever?
Why withdrawest Thou Thy hand, even Thy right hand, out of the midst of Thy bosom for ever?
But God is our king before the ages; He hath worked salvation in the midst of the earth.
Thou didst establish the sea by Thy strength; Thou brakest the heads of the dragons in the water.
Thou didst crush the head of the dragon; Thou gavest him to be meat for the people of the Ethiopians.
Thou didst cleave the fountains and the torrents; Thou driedst up the rivers of Ethan.
The day is Thine, the night also is Thine; Thou hast prepared the light and the sun.
Thou hast set all the borders of the earth; Thou hast made the summer and spring.
Remember this Thy creation. The enemy hath reproached the Lord, and a foolish people hath provoked Thy name.
O deliver not over unto the wild beasts the soul that confesseth Thee; forget not the souls of Thy poor for ever.
Have respect unto Thy covenant, for the dark places of the earth are filled with the habitations of iniquity.
O let not the humble and ashamed be turned away; the poor and the needy shall praise Thy name.
Arise, O God, plead Thine Own cause; remember the reproach that is made against Thee by the foolish man all the day long.
Forget not the voice of Thy suppliants; the pride of them that hate Thee ascendeth continually.
Unto Thee, O God will give thanks; unto Thee will we give thanks, and call upon Thy name. I will tell of all Thy wondrous works.
When I shall be given the appointed time, I will judge uprightly.
The earth and all the inhabitants thereof are melted; I have made fast the pillars of it.
I said unto the transgressors, Transgress not; and to the sinners, Lift not up the horn.
Lift not up your horn on high, and speak not unrighteousness against God.
For judgment cometh neither from the outgoings of the sun, nor from the west, nor from the desert mountains; for God is judge.
He putteth down one, and raiseth up another; for in the hand of the Lord is a cup full of unmingled wine.
And He hath turned it from this side to that, but the dregs thereof are not wholly emptied out; all the sinners of the earth shall drink of them.
But I will rejoice for ever; I will sing praises to the God of Jacob.
All the horns of the sinners also will I break, but the horn of the righteous shall be exalted.
In Judah is God known; His name is great in Israel.
And His place hath been in peace, and His dwelling place in Zion.
There brake He the power of the bow, the weapon, and the sword, and the battle.
Thou shinest wondrously from the everlasting mountains.
All the foolish of heart were troubled, they have slept their sleep, and all the men of riches have found nothing in their hands.
At Thy rebuke, O God of Jacob, all those that mounted on horses slumbered.
Thou art to be feared, and who shall withstand Thee? From that time is Thy wrath.
Thou didst cause judgment to be heard from heaven.
The earth feared, and was still, when God arose to judgment, to save all the meek of the earth.
For the inward thought of man shall praise Thee, and the remainder of his inward thought shall keep a feast unto Thee.
Vow, and pay unto the Lord Thy God; all that be round about Him shall bring presents,
Unto Him that is to be feared, and that taketh away the spirit of princes; unto Him that is to be feared among the kings of the earth.
I cried unto the Lord with my voice, even unto God with my voice; and He was gave ear unto me.
In the day of my trouble I sought God, with my hands lifted up by night before Him; and I was not deceived. My soul refused to be comforted.
I remembered God, and was gladdened; I pondered, and my spirit fainted.
My eyes prevented the morning watches; I was troubled, and spake not.
I have considered the days of old, and called to remembrance the years of ages past, and meditated.
I pondered in my heart in the night, and my spirit made diligent search.
Will the Lord cast off unto the ages, and will He be favourable no more?
Or will He cut off His mercy for ever, His word from generation to generation?
Or will God forget to shew mercy? or will He in His wrath shut up His tender mercy for ever?
And I said, Now have I begun; this change is of the right hand of the Most High.
I remembered the works of the Lord, for I will remember Thy wonders from the beginning.
I will meditate also on all Thy works, and ponder Thy doings.
Thy way, O God, is in the sanctuary; who is so great a God as our God? Thou art the God that doest wonders.
Thou hast made known Thy strength among the people; Thou hast with Thine arm redeemed Thy people, the sons of Jacob and of Joseph.
The waters saw Thee, O God; the waters saw Thee, and were afraid; the depths were troubled.
Great was the noise of the waters; the clouds gave voice, for Thine arrows went abroad.
The voice of Thy thunder was in their circuit, and Thy lightnings lightened the world; the earth shook and trembled.
Thy ways are in the sea, and Thy paths in many waters; and Thy footsteps shall not be known.
Thou leddest Thy people like sheep, by the hand of Moses and Aaron.
Give heed, O my people, to my law; incline your ear to the words of my mouth.
I will open my mouth in parables; I will utter dark sayings of old;
Which we have heard and have known, and our fathers have told us.
They were not hid from their children in another generation; they declared the praises of the Lord, and His mighty acts, and His wonderful works that He hath done.
And He raised up a testimony in Jacob, and appointed a law in Israel,
Even those things which He commanded our fathers, that they should make them known to their children;
That another generation might know them, even the children which should be born; that they should arise, and declare them to their children.
That they might set their hope in God, and not forget the works of God; but seek His commandments.
That they might not be as their fathers, a perverse and provoking generation,
A generation that set not their heart aright, and kept not their spirit stedfast with God.
The children of Ephraim, bending and shooting the bow, turned back in the day of battle.
They kept not the covenant of God, and refused to walk in His law.
They forgat His benefits, and His wonders that He had shewed them,
Marvellous things that He did in the sight of their fathers, in the land of Egypt, in the field of Tanis.
He divided the sea, and brought them through; He made the waters stand as in a wineskin.
In the daytime also He led them with a cloud, and all the night with a light of fire.
He clave the rock in the wilderness, and gave them to drink as out of a great deep.
He brought water also out of the rock, and brought down waters as rivers.
And they sinned yet more against Him; they provoked the Most High in the place without water.
And they tempted God in their hearts, by asking meat for their souls.
Yea, they spake against God, and said, Can God not furnish a table in the wilderness?
Because He smote a rock, and waters gushed out, and the torrents overflowed: can not He give bread also, or furnish a table for His people?
Therefore the Lord heard this, and was provoked; and a fire was kindled in Jacob, and wrath also came up against Israel.
Because they believed not in God, and hoped not in His salvation.
And He commanded the clouds from above, and opened the doors of heaven,
And He rained down manna upon them to eat, and gave them bread of heaven.
Man ate the bread of angels; He sent them provision to the full.
He removed the south wind from heaven, and by His power brought in the south west wind.
He rained flesh also upon them as dust, and feathered fowls like as the sands of the sea,
Which fell in the midst of their camp, round about their habitations.
And they did eat, and were well filled, and He gave them their own desire; and they were not disappointed of their lust.
But while the meat was yet in their mouths, the wrath of God rose up against them, and He slew the fat among them, and fettered the chosen men of Israel.
In all these things they sinned yet more, and believed not for His wondrous works.
And their days were consumed in vanity, and their years in haste.
When He slew them, then they sought Him, and they returned and called early unto God.
And they remembered that God was their helper, and the Most High God their redeemer.
Yet they did love Him only with their mouth, and they lied to Him with their tongue.
For their heart was not right with Him, neither were they stedfast in His covenant.
But He is full of compassion, and will forgive their sins, and will destroy them not.
And many a time will He turn His anger away, and not kindle all His wrath.
And He remembered that they were but flesh, a breath that passeth away, and cometh not again.
How oft did they provoke Him in the wilderness, and anger Him in the land without water!
They turned back and tempted God, and provoked the Holy One of Israel.
They remembered not His hand, nor the day when He redeemed them from the hand of the oppressor.
How He had wrought His signs in Egypt, and His wonders in the field of Tanis.
And He turned their rivers into blood; and their showers, that they might not drink.
He sent the dog fly against them, which devoured them; and the frog, which destroyed them.
He gave also their fruits unto the cankerworm, and their labours unto the locust.
And He destroyed their vineyards with hail, and their mulberry trees with frost.
And He gave up their cattle also to the hail, and their substance to the fire.
And He sent against them the wrath of His anger; anger, and wrath, and trouble, a mission of evil angels.
He made a way to His wrath, and spared not their souls from death, but shut up their cattle in death,
And smote all the firstborn in Egypt, the firstfruits of all their labour in the tabernacles of Ham.
And He took away His people like sheep, and led them in the wilderness like a flock.
And He guided them in hope, and they feared not; and the sea overwhelmed their enemies.
And He brought them into the mountain of His sanctuary, even to this mountain which His right hand had purchased.
He cast out the heathen also before them, and divided them an inheritance by lot,
And made the tribes of Israel to dwell in their tents.
Yet they tempted and provoked the Most High God, and kept not His testimonies,
But turned back, and brake covenant, like their fathers; they became like a crooked bow.
And they provoked Him to anger among their hills, and moved Him to jealousy with their graven images.
God heard, and regarded them no more, and greatly abhorred Israel.
And He forsook His tabernacle at Shiloh, His dwelling where He dwelt among men.
And delivered their strength into captivity, and their beauty into the enemy's hands.
He shut up his people also with a sword, and regarded His inheritance no more.
Fire consumed their young men, and their maidens made no lamentation.
Their priests fell by the sword, and none shall weep for their widows.
Then the Lord awaked as one out of sleep, and like a mighty man that hath been heated with wine.
And He smote His enemies on their hinder parts; He put them to a perpetual reproach.
Moreover, He refused the tabernacle of Joseph, and chose not the tribe of Ephraim;
But He chose the tribe of Judah, the Mount Zion which He loved.
And He built His sanctuary like that of an unicorn; He established it upon the earth for ever.
He chose David also His servant, and took him from the flocks of sheep.
From following the ewes great with young He took him, to shepherd Jacob His servant, and Israel His inheritance.
So he shepherded them in the innocency of his heart, and guided them by the skilfulness of his hands.
O God, the heathen are come into Thine inheritance, Thy holy temple have they defiled; they have made Jerusalem as an orchard watcher's hut.
The dead bodies of Thy servants have they given to be meat unto the fowls of the air, the flesh of Thy saints unto the beasts of the earth.
Their blood have they shed like water round about Jerusalem, and there was none to bury them.
We are become a reproach to our neighbours, a scorn and derision to them that are round about us.
How long, Lord, wilt Thou be angry for ever? Shall Thy jealousy be kindled like fire?
Pour out Thy wrath upon the heathen that have not known Thee, and upon the kingdoms that have not called upon Thy name.
For they have devoured Jacob, and laid waste his dwelling place.
O remember not our former iniquities; let Thy tender mercies speedily prevent us, O Lord, for we are become exceeding poor.
Help us, O God our Saviour, for the glory of Thy name; deliver us, O Lord, and be gracious unto our sins for Thy name's sake.
Lest the heathen say, Where is their God? Yea, let there be known among the heathen in our sight the revenging of the blood of Thy servants which hath been shed.
Let the groaning of the prisoners come before Thee; according to the greatness of Thine arm show Thy care for the sons of the slain.
And render unto our neighbours sevenfold into their bosom the reproach wherewith they have reproached Thee, O Lord.
For we are Thy people, and the sheep of Thy pasture. We will give Thee thanks, O God, for ever; we will shew forth Thy praise from generation to generation.
Give ear, O shepherd of Israel, Thou that leadest Joseph like a sheep.
Thou that sittest upon the Cherubim, shew Thyself before Ephraim, Benjamin and Manasseh.
Stir up Thy might, and come to save us.
Turn us again, O God, and cause Thy face to shine, and we shall be saved.
O Lord God of hosts, how long wilt Thou be angry against the prayer of Thy servants?
Wilt Thou feed us with the bread of tears, and give us tears to drink in great measure?
Thou hast made us a strife among our neighbours, and our enemies have scoffed at us.
Turn us again, O Lord of hosts, and cause Thy face to shine; and we shall be saved.
Thou hast brought a vine out of Egypt; Thou hast cast out the heathen, and planted it.
Thou preparedst the way before it, and Thou plantedst the roots thereof, and it filled the earth.
The shadows thereof covered the mountains, and the boughs thereof the cedars of God.
She stretched forth her shoots unto the sea, and her branches unto the rivers.
Why hast Thou broken down her hedge, and all they that pass by the way do pluck the fruit?
The boar out of the wood hath wasted it, and the wild beast hath devoured it.
Turn again, O God of hosts; and look down from heaven, and behold, and visit this vine.
And perfect that which Thy right hand hath planted, and look upon the son of man, whom Thou hast made strong for Thyself.
It is burned with fire, and digged up; they shall perish at the rebuke of Thy countenance.
Let Thy hand be upon the man of Thy right hand, and upon the son of man whom Thou madest strong for Thyself.
And we will not depart from Thee; Thou shalt quicken us, and we will call upon Thy name.
Turn us again, O Lord God of hosts; and cause Thy face to shine; and we shall be saved.
Rejoice in God our helper; shout with jubilation unto the God of Jacob.
Sound the trumpet in the new moon, even in the notable day of our feast.
For this is a statute for Israel, and a judgment of the God of Jacob.
This He ordained in Joseph for a testimony, when he went out of the land of Egypt; he heard a language that he knew not.
He removed his back from the burdens; his hands had slaved at the basket.
Thou calledst upon Me in trouble, and I delivered Thee; I heard Thee in the secret place of the tempest, I proved Thee at the waters of strife.
Hear, O My people, and I will speak unto Thee, O Israel, and I will testify unto Thee.
If Thou wilt hearken unto Me, there shall no new God be in Thee, neither shalt Thou worship a strange god.
For I am the Lord Thy God, Who brought thee out of the land of Egypt; open Thy mouth wide, and I will fill it.
But my people would not hearken to My voice, and Israel gave no heed to Me.
So I let them go according to their hearts' desires; they shall walk in their own ways.
If my people had hearkened unto Me, if Israel had walked in My ways,
I should soon have humbled their enemies, and laid Mine hand on them that afflicted them.
The enemies of the Lord have lied unto Him, but in that age their time shall come.
He fed them also with the fat of wheat, and with honey out of the rock He satisfied them.
God stood in the congregation of the gods, and in their midst He shall judge gods.
How long will ye judge unjustly, and accept the person of sinners?
Judge for the fatherless and the poor; do justice to the humble and needy.
Rescue the poor and needy; deliver him out of the hand of the sinner.
They have not known, nor understood; they walk on in darkness. Let all the foundations of the earth be moved.
I have said, Ye are gods, and all of you are the sons of the Most High.
But ye shall die like men, and fall like one of the princes.
Arise, O God, judge the earth, for Thou shalt inherit among all the nations.
O God, who shall be likened unto Thee? Hold not Thy peace, and be not still, O God.
For lo, Thine enemies have made a tumult, and they that hate Thee have lifted up the head.
They have taken wicked counsel against Thy people, and consulted against Thy holy ones.
They have said, Come, let us cut them off, that they be no more a nation; and let the name of Israel be no more in remembrance.
For they have consulted together with one consent; they have made a covenant against Thee, the tents of the Edomites and the Ishmaelites,
Moab and the Hagarenes, Gebal and Ammon and Amalek, and the strangers, with them that dwell at Tyre.
Assur also is come with them; they have holpen the children of Lot.
Do unto them as Thou didst unto Midian and Sisera, as to Jabin at the brook of Kison.
They were destroyed at Endor, they became as dung for the earth.
Make their princes like Oreb and Zeeb, and Zebah and Zalmunna, yea, all their princes who said, Let us take to ourselves the sanctuary of God for an inheritance.
O my God, make them like a wheel, as the stubble before the face of the wind,
As the fire that shall burn the forest, as the flame that shall consume the mountains.
So shalt Thou pursue them with Thy tempest, and trouble them in Thy wrath.
Fill their faces with dishonour, and they shall seek Thy name, O Lord.
Let them be ashamed and troubled for ever and ever, and let them be confounded and destroyed.
And let them know that the Lord is Thy name; Thou alone art the Most High over all the earth.
How beloved are Thy tabernacles, O Lord of hosts. My soul longeth and fainteth for the courts of the Lord; my heart and my flesh have rejoiced in the living God.
Yea, the sparrow hath found her an house, and the turtledove a nest for herself, where she may lay her young; even Thine altars, O Lord of hosts, my King and my God.
Blessed are they that dwell in Thy house; they shall praise Thee for ever and ever.
Blessed is the man whose help is from Thee; in his heart he hath disposed to ascend, in the vale of weeping, in the place which he hath appointed.
For the lawgiver shall give blessings, they shall go from strength to strength; the God of gods shall be seen in Zion.
O Lord God of hosts, hear my prayer; give ear, O God of Jacob.
Behold, O God our defender, and look upon the face of Thine anointed.
For one day in Thy courts is better than thousands elsewhere. I have chosen rather to be an outcast in the house of my God than to dwell in the tents of sinners.
For the Lord loveth mercy and truth, God will give grace and glory; the Lord will not withhold good things from them that walk in innocency.
O Lord God of hosts, blessed is the man that hopeth in Thee.
Lord, Thou hast been favourable unto Thy land; Thou hast turned back the captivity of Jacob.
Thou hast forgiven the iniquities of Thy people; Thou hast covered all their sins.
Thou hast made all Thy wrath to cease; Thou hast turned away from the wrath of Thine anger .
Turn us back, O God of our salvation, and turn away Thine anger from us.
Wilt Thou be angry with us for ever, or wilt Thou draw out Thy wrath from generation to generation?
Thou shalt turn again, O God, and quicken us; and Thy people shall be glad in Thee.
Shew us Thy mercy, O Lord, and grant us Thy salvation.
I will hear what the Lord God will speak in me; for He will speak peace to His people, and to His saints, and to them that turn their heart unto Him.
Surely His salvation is nigh unto them that fear Him, that glory may dwell in our land.
Mercy and truth are met together; righteousness and peace have kissed each other.
Truth is sprung out of the earth, and righteousness hath looked down from heaven.
For the Lord will give goodness, and our land shall yield her fruit.
Righteousness shall go before Him, and shall set His steps in the way.
Bow down Thine ear, O Lord, and hear me, for I am poor and needy.
Preserve my soul, for I am holy; O Thou my God, save Thy servant that hopeth in Thee.
Be merciful unto me, O Lord; for unto Thee will I cry all the day long.
Rejoice the soul of Thy servant, for unto Thee have I lifted up my soul.
For Thou, Lord, art good and gentle, and plenteous in mercy unto all them that call upon Thee.
Give ear, O Lord, unto my prayer, and attend to the voice of my supplication.
In the day of my trouble I cried to Thee, for Thou hast heard me.
Among the gods there is none like unto Thee, O Lord; neither are there any works like unto Thy works.
All the nations whom Thou hast made shall come and worship before Thee, O Lord, and shall glorify Thy name.
For Thou art great, and doest wondrous things, Thou art God alone.
Guide me in Thy way, O Lord, and I will walk in Thy truth; let my heart rejoice that I may fear Thy name.
I will praise Thee, O Lord my God, with all my heart, and I will glorify Thy name for evermore.
For great is Thy mercy toward me, and Thou hast delivered my soul from the lowest Hades.
O God, the transgressors are risen up against me, and the assembly of the mighty hath sought after my soul, and have not set Thee before them.
But Thou, O Lord my God, art full of compassion, and merciful, longsuffering, and plenteous in mercy, and true.
O look Thou upon me, and have mercy upon me; give Thy strength unto Thy servant, and save the son of Thine handmaid.
Work in me a sign unto good, and let them which hate me see and be ashamed; for Thou, O Lord, hast holpen me, and comforted me.
His foundations are in the holy mountains.
The Lord loveth the gates of Zion more than all the dwellings of Jacob.
Glorious things are spoken of thee, O city of God.
I will make mention of Rahab and Babylon to them that know me. And behold the foreigners, and those of Tyre, and the people of the Ethiopians; these were born there.
A man shall say, Zion is my mother, and, That man was born in her, and, The Most High Himself hath established her.
The Lord shall tell it in His writings of the people and of the princes, even of them that have been born in her.
How joyful are all they that have their habitation in Thee!
O Lord God of my salvation, I have cried by day and night before Thee.
Let my prayer come before Thee; incline Thine ear unto my supplication.
For my soul is full of evils, and my life hath drawn nigh unto Hades.
I am counted with them that go down into the pit; I am become as a man that hath no help, free among the dead.
Like the bodies of the slain that sleep in the grave, whom Thou rememberest no more: and they are cut off from Thy hand.
They have laid me in the lowest pit, in darkness, and in the shadow of death.
Thy wrath presseth hard upon me, and Thou hast brought all Thy waves upon me.
Thou hast put away mine acquaintance far from me; they have made me an abomination unto them.
I am delivered up, and have not come forth; mine eyes are grown weak by reason of poverty.
Lord, I have called upon Thee all the day long; I have stretched out my hands unto Thee.
Wilt Thou work wonders for the dead? or shall physicians raise them up to praise Thee?
Shall any in the grave tell of Thy mercy, and of Thy truth in that destruction?
Shall Thy wonders be known in that darkness, and Thy righteousness in the land of forgetfulness?
But unto Thee have I cried, O Lord, and in the morning shall my prayer prevent Thee.
Lord, why castest Thou off my soul, and turnest Thou Thy face away from me?
I am poor and in troubles from my youth up; yea, having been exalted, I was humbled and brought to distress.
Thy fierce wrath hath gone over me, and Thy terrors have troubled me. They came round about me like water; all the day long they compassed me about together.
Friend and neighbour hast Thou put far from me, and mine acquaintance, because of my misery.
I will sing of Thy mercies, O Lord, for ever; with my mouth will I shew forth Thy truth from generation to generation.
For Thou hast said, Mercy shall be built up for ever; Thy truth shall be established in the heavens.
I have made a covenant with My chosen; I have sworn unto David My servant.
Thy seed will I establish for ever, and build up thy throne from generation to generation.
The heavens shall declare Thy wonders, O Lord, Thy truth also in the congregation of the saints.
For who in the clouds shall be compared unto the Lord? and who among the sons of God shall be likened unto the Lord?
God Who is glorified in the assembly of the saints, great and terrible toward all them that are round about Him.
O Lord God of hosts, who is like unto Thee? Thou art mighty, O Lord, and Thy truth is round about Thee.
Thou art ruler the might of the sea, and Thou stillest the tumult of her waves.
Thou hast humbled the proud, as one that is slain; and Thou hast scattered Thine enemies with the arm of Thy strength.
The heavens are Thine, the earth also is Thine; as for the world and the fulness thereof, Thou hast founded them.
The north and the sea Thou hast created them; Tabor and Hermon shall rejoice in Thy name.
Thine is the mighty arm. Let Thine hand be strengthened, let Thy right hand be exalted.
Justice and judgment are the establishment of Thy throne; mercy and truth shall go before Thy face. Blessed is the people that knoweth jubilation.
They shall walk, O Lord, in the light of Thy countenance, and in Thy name shall they rejoice all the day, and in Thy righteousness shall they be exalted.
For Thou art the glory of their strength, and in Thy favour our horn shall be exalted.
For of the Lord is our help, and of the Holy One of Israel, our King.
Then Thou spakest in a vision to Thy sons, and saidst, I have laid help upon one that is mighty, I have exalted one chosen out of My people.
I have found David My servant, with My holy oil have I anointed him.
For My hand shall be an ally unto him, Mine arm also shall strengthen him. His enemy shall have no advantage over him, nor shall the son of wickedness have power to hurt him more.
And I will cut down his foes before his face, and put to flight them that hate him.
And My truth and My mercy shall be with him, and in My name shall his horn be exalted.
I will set his hand also in the sea, and his right hand in the rivers.
He shall cry unto Me, and say, Thou art my Father, my God, and the Help of my salvation.
Also I will make him My firstborn, higher than the kings of the earth.
My mercy will I keep for him for evermore, and My covenant shall stand fast with him.
His seed also will I establish for ever and ever, and his throne shall be as the days of heaven.
If his sons forsake My law, and walk not in My judgments;
If they profane My statutes, and keep not My commandments;
Then will I visit their iniquities with a rod, and their transgressions with stripes.
Nevertheless My mercy will I not utterly take from them, nor wrong them in My truth.
Neither will I profane My covenant, nor make void the things that go out of My lips.
Once have I sworn by My holiness, that I will not lie unto David.
His seed shall endure for ever, and his throne as the sun before Me, and as the moon that is established for ever, and as a faithful witness in heaven.
But Thou hast cast off and brought to nought; Thou hast been wroth with Thine anointed.
Thou hast destroyed the covenant of Thy servant; Thou hast profaned his sanctuary to the ground.
Thou hast broken down all his hedges; Thou hast made his strong hold a terror.
All that pass by the way have spoiled him; he is become a reproach to his neighbours.
Thou hast set up the right hand of them that afflict him, Thou hast made all his enemies to rejoice.
Thou hast turned away the help of his sword, and hast not holpen him in battle.
Thou hast made an end of his purification; Thou hast cast his throne down to the ground.
The days of his time hast Thou shortened; Thou hast covered him with shame.
How long, O Lord, wilt Thou turn away for ever? Shall Thy wrath burn like fire?
Remember what my substance is; for hast Thou created all the sons of man in vain?
What man is he that liveth, and shall not see death? Shall he deliver his soul out of the hand of Hades?
Where are Thine ancient mercies, O Lord, which Thou swarest unto David in Thy truth?
Remember, O Lord, the reproach of Thy servants, which I have endured in my bosom of many nations.
Wherewith Thine enemies have reproached, O Lord, wherewith they have reproached the recompense of Thine anointed.
Blessed be the Lord for evermore. So be it. So be it.
O Lord, Thou hast been our refuge from generation to generation.
Before the mountains were brought forth, and the earth and the world were formed, from everlasting to everlasting Thou art.
Turn not man away unto lowliness; Thou hast said, Return, ye sons of men.
For a thousand years in Thy sight, O Lord, are but as yesterday which is past, and as a watch in the night.
Things of no account shall their years be; in the morning as the grass shall man pass away.
In the morning he shall flourish, and pass away; in the evening he shall fall, and be withered and dry.
For we have fainted away in Thy wrath, and have been troubled in Thine anger.
Thou hast set our iniquities before Thee, our life in the light of Thy countenance.
For all our days are spent, and by Thy wrath have we fainted away; our years are reckoned as a spider's web.
The days of our years are threescore years and ten, and if we be in strength, then fourscore years; and the greater part of these is labour and travail, for mildness is come upon us, and we shall be chastened.
Who knoweth the power of Thine wrath? and for fear of Thee who can recount Thine anger?
So make Thy right hand known to me, and to them that in heart are learned in wisdom.
Return, O Lord, how long? and be Thou entreated for Thy servants.
We have been satisfied in the morning with Thy mercy, O Lord, and we have rejoiced, and been glad.
Let us be glad all our days for the days wherein Thou hast humbled us, for the years wherein we have seen evils.
And look upon Thy servants, and upon Thy works, and guide Thou their sons.
And let the brightness of the Lord our God be upon us; prosper Thou the work of our hands upon us, yea, prosper Thou the work of our hands.
He that dwelleth in the help of the Most High shall abide under the shelter of the God of heaven.
He shall say unto the Lord, Thou art my helper and my refuge; He is my God, and in Him will I hope.
For He shall deliver thee from the snare of the hunters, and from every sharp word.
He shall overshadow thee with His shoulders, and under His wings shalt thou trust; His truth shall compass thee with a shield.
Thou shalt not be afraid for the terror by night, nor for the arrow that flieth by day; nor for the thing that walketh in darkness, nor for the mishap and the noonday devil.
A thousand shall fall at thy side, and ten thousand at thy right hand; but it shall not come nigh thee.
Only with thine eyes shalt thou behold, and see the reward of sinners.
Because Thou, Lord, art my hope. Thou hast made the Most High thy refuge.
There shall no evils befall thee, neither shall any plague come nigh thy dwelling.
For He shall give His angels charge over thee, to keep thee in all thy ways.
They shall bear thee up in their hands, lest at any time thou dash thy foot against a stone.
Thou shalt tread upon the asp and basilisk, and the lion and the dragon shalt thou trample under foot.
Because he hath set his hope in Me, I will deliver him; I will shelter him, because he hath known My name.
He shall cry unto Me, and I will hearken unto him; I am with him in trouble, and I will deliver him, and glorify him.
With length of days will I satisfy him, and shew him My salvation.
It is good to give thanks unto the Lord, and to sing praises unto Thy name, O Most High.
To shew forth Thy mercy in the morning, and Thy truth in the night, upon a psaltery of ten strings, with a song upon the harp.
For Thou, Lord, hast made me glad through Thy doings, and I will rejoice in the works of Thy hands.
O Lord, how great are Thy works! Thy thoughts are very deep.
A senseless man knoweth not, neither shall a fool understand this.
When the sinners spring as the grass, and all the workers of iniquity do look down,
It is that they may be destroyed for ever and ever.
But Thou, Lord, art Most High for evermore.
For lo, Thine enemies, O Lord, for lo, Thine enemies shall perish, and all the workers of iniquity shall be scattered.
But my horn shall be exalted like the horn of an unicorn, and mine old age shall be strengthened with rich oil.
Mine eye also hath looked down upon my enemies, and mine ear shall hear of the wicked that rise up against me.
The righteous shall flourish like a palm tree, and increase like a cedar of Lebanon.
Those that be planted in the house of the Lord shall flourish in the courts of our God.
They shall still bring forth fruit in a ripe old age, and happy shall they be to shew
That Lord our God is upright, and there is no unrighteousness in Him.
The Lord reigneth, He is clothed with majesty; the Lord is clothed with strength, and hath girded Himself. For He hath stablished the world, which shall not be moved.
Thy throne is established of old, Thou art from everlasting.
The rivers have lifted up, O Lord, the rivers have lifted up their voices; the rivers shall lift up their waves at the voice of many waters.
Wonderful are the surgings of the sea, the Lord is wonderful on high.
Thy testimonies are very sure; holiness becometh Thine house, O Lord, unto length of days.
The Lord is God, to whom vengeance belongeth; the God of vengeance hath spoken freely.
Lift up Thyself, Thou that judgest the earth; render their reward to the proud.
Lord, how long shall sinners, how long shall sinners boast?
How long shall they utter and speak unrighteousness? How long shall all the workers of iniquity speak thus?
They have brought Thy people low, O Lord, and afflict Thine inheritance.
They have slain the widow and the fatherless, and have murdered the stranger.
Yet have they said, The Lord shall not see it, neither shall the God of Jacob perceive it.
Understand, ye senseless among the people, and ye fools, at length be wise.
He that planted the ear, shall He not hear? or He that formed the eye, doth He not perceive?
He that chastiseth the heathen, shall not He rebuke, even He that teacheth man knowledge?
The Lord knoweth the thoughts of men, that they are vanity.
Blessed is the man whom Thou shalt chasten, O Lord, and teach out of Thy law.
That Thou mayest give him rest from the days of evil, until a pit be digged for the sinner.
For the Lord will not cast off His people, neither will He forsake His inheritance,
Until righteousness return unto judgment, and all the upright in heart are nigh unto it.
Who will rise up for me against the evil doers? or who will stand up with me against the workers of iniquity?
Unless the Lord had been my help, my soul had almost dwelt in hell.
When I said, My foot hath slipped; Thy mercy, O Lord, brought me help.
According to the multitude of my sorrows in my heart, Thy comforts have given gladness to my soul.
Let not the throne of iniquity have fellowship with Thee, which frameth mischief in the name of the law.
They will hunt down the soul of the righteous, and condemn the innocent blood.
But the Lord is my refuge, and my God is the helper of my hope.
And the Lord shall bring upon them their own iniquity, and according to their own wickedness the Lord God shall destroy them.
O come, let us exult in the Lord; let us shout in jubilation unto God our Saviour.
For the Lord is a great God, and a great king over all the earth.
For in His hand are the ends of the earth, and the heights of the mountains are His also.
For the sea is His, and He made it; and His hands formed the dry land.
O come, let us worship and fall down before Him, and weep before the Lord that made us.
For He is our God, and we are the people of His pasture, and the sheep of His hand.
Today if ye will hear His voice, harden not your hearts, as in the provocation, as in the day of temptation in the wilderness.
For your fathers tempted Me, proved Me, and saw My works.
Forty years long was I grieved with that generation, and said, They do always err in their hearts, and they have not known My ways.
So I sware in My wrath, They shall not enter into My rest.
O sing unto the Lord a new song; sing unto the Lord, all the earth. Sing unto the Lord, bless His name; shew forth His salvation from day to day.
Declare His glory among the heathen, and His wonders among all peoples.
For the Lord is great, and greatly to be praised; He is to be feared above all gods.
For all the gods of the nations are demons, but the Lord made the heavens.
Praise and beauty are before Him; holiness and majesty are in His sanctuary.
Ascribe unto the Lord, O ye kindred of the nations, ascribe unto the Lord glory and honour; ascribe unto the Lord glory to His name.
Bring sacrifices, and go into His courts: worship the Lord in His holy court. Let all the earth be moved at His presence.
Say among the heathen that the Lord reigneth; for He hath established the world, which shall not be moved; He shall judge the peoples in uprightness.
Let the heavens rejoice, and let the earth be glad; let the sea be moved, and the fulness thereof. The fields shall rejoice, and all that is therein.
Then shall all the trees of the wood rejoice before the Lord; for He cometh, for He cometh to judge the earth.
He shall judge the world with righteousness, and the peoples with His truth.
The Lord reigneth, let the earth rejoice; let the multitude of isles be glad.
Clouds and darkness are round about Him; righteousness and judgment are the foundation of His throne.
Fire shall go before Him, and shall burn up His enemies round about.
His lightnings shone forth throughout the world; the earth saw, and was moved.
The mountains melted like wax at the presence of the Lord, at the presence of the Lord of the whole earth.
The heavens declared His righteousness, and all the peoples saw His glory.
Let all them be put to shame that worship graven things, that boast themselves of their idols. Worship Him, all ye His angels.
Zion heard, and was glad, and the daughters of Judah rejoiced because of Thy judgments, O Lord.
For Thou art Lord Most High over all the earth; Thou art exalted far above all the gods.
Ye that love the Lord, hate evil. The Lord preserveth the souls of His saints; He will deliver them out of the hand of the sinner.
Light is dawned for the righteous, and gladness for the upright in heart.
Rejoice in the Lord, ye righteous, and give thanks at the remembrance of His holiness.
O sing unto the Lord a new song, for the Lord hath done marvellous things.
His right hand, and His holy arm, have wrought salvation for Him.
The Lord hath made known His salvation; His righteousness hath He openly shewed in the sight of the heathen.
He hath remembered His mercy to Jacob, and His truth to the house of Israel. All the ends of the earth have seen the salvation of our God.
Shout with jubilation unto God, all the earth; sing, rejoice, and make melody.
Shout with jubilation before the Lord our King; let the sea be moved, and the fulness thereof; the world, and all they that dwell therein.
The rivers shall clap their hands, the mountains shall rejoice at the presence of the Lord; for He cometh, He cometh to judge the earth.
He shall judge the world with righteousness, and the peoples with equity.
The Lord reigneth; let the people rage: He sitteth upon the cherubim, let the earth be moved.
The Lord is great in Zion, and He is high above all the peoples.
Let them praise Thy great name, for it is terrible and holy; the king's honour also loveth judgment.
Thou hast prepared equity, Thou hast executed judgment and righteousness in Jacob.
Exalt ye the Lord our God, and worship at His footstool; for He is holy.
Moses and Aaron among His priests, and Samuel among them that call upon His name; they called upon the Lord, and He heard them.
He spake unto them in the pillar of the cloud, for they kept His testimonies, and the ordinances that He gave them.
Thou heardest them, O Lord our God; Thou wast ready to forgive them, O God, yet Thou tookest vengeance on all their devices.
Exalt the Lord our God, and worship at His holy mountain; for the Lord our God is holy.
Shout with jubilation unto God, all the earth;
Serve the Lord with gladness; come before His presence with rejoicing.
Know ye that the Lord, He is our God; it is He that hath made us, and not we ourselves; we are His people, and the sheep of His pasture.
Enter into His gates with thanksgiving, and into His courts with hymns; be thankful unto Him, and praise His name.
For the Lord is good; His mercy endureth for ever and ever, and His truth from generation to generation.
I will sing of mercy and judgment unto Thee O Lord.
I will sing, and have understanding in a perfect way; when wilt Thou come unto me? I walked within my house in the innocency of my heart.
I have set no unlawful thing before mine eyes; I hated the workers of iniquities.
A perverse heart cleaved not unto me, and I would not know the wicked man that turned aside from me.
Whoso privily slandered his neighbour, him did I drive away from me. With him that had a proud eye and an insatiate heart, I would not eat.
Mine eyes were upon the faithful of the earth, that they might sit with me; the man that walked in the blameless way, he served me.
He that worketh pride dwelt not within my house; he that speaketh unjust things prospered not in my sight.
In the morning I slew all the sinners of the land, that I might cut off all the workers of iniquity from the city of the Lord.
Hear my prayer, O Lord, and let my cry come unto Thee.
Turn not away Thy face from me; in the day when I am in trouble incline Thine ear unto me; in the day when I call unto Thee hear me speedily.
For my days are vanished like smoke, and my bones are consumed like wood for burning.
I am smitten like grass, and my heart is withered, for I forgat to eat my bread.
By reason of the voice of my groaning, my bone hath cleaved to my flesh.
I am become like a pelican of the wilderness; I am become like an owl within a ruined habitation.
I have watched, and am become as a sparrow that sitteth alone upon the house top.
Mine enemies reproached me all the day, and they that praised me are sworn against me.
For I have eaten ashes as it were bread, and mingled my drink with weeping, because of Thy wrath and Thine anger:
For Thou hast lifted me up, and cast me down.
My days have declined like a shadow, and I am withered like grass.
But Thou, O Lord, endurest for ever, and Thy remembrance from generation to generation.
Thou shalt arise, and have pity upon Zion; for it is time to pity her, yea, the time is come.
For Thy servants have taken pleasure in her stones, and they shall have pity upon the dust thereof.
And the heathen shall fear Thy name, O Lord, and all the kings of the earth Thy glory.
For the Lord shall build up Zion, and He shall appear in His glory.
He hath regarded the prayer of the humble, and hath not despised their supplication.
Let this be written for a generation to come, and the people that shall be created shall praise the Lord.
For He hath looked out from His holy height; from heaven did the Lord beheld the earth,
To hear the groaning of them that be fettered; to deliver the sons of the slain;
To declare the name of the Lord in Zion, and His praise in Jerusalem.
When the peoples are gathered together, and the kings, to serve the Lord.
He answered him in the way of his strength, Declare unto me the fewness of my days.
Take me not away in the midst of my days; Thy years are from generation to generation.
In the beginning, Lord, Thou hast laid the foundations of the earth, and the heavens are the work of Thy hands.
They shall perish, but Thou endurest; yea, all of them shall wax old as a garment, and as a vesture shalt Thou fold them, and they shall be changed.
But Thou art the same, and Thy years shall not fail.
The sons of Thy servants shall dwell, and their seed shall be guided aright for ever.
Bless the Lord, O my soul; and all that is within me bless His
holy name.
Bless the Lord, O my soul, and forget not all His benefits:
Who forgiveth all thine iniquities, Who healeth all thine infirmities,
Who redeemeth thy life from corruption, Who crowneth thee with mercy and lovingkindness,
Who satisfieth thy desire with good things; thy youth shall be renewed like the eagle's.
The Lord executeth mercy and judgment for all that are wronged.
He made known His ways unto Moses, His will unto the sons of Israel.
The Lord is compassionate and merciful, longsuffering and plenteous in mercy. He will not always be angry, neither will He keep His wrath for ever.
He hath not dealt with us according to our sins, nor rewarded us according to our iniquities.
For as the heaven is high above the earth, so hath the Lord made His mercy to prevail over them that fear Him.
As far as the east is from the west, so far hath He removed our iniquities from us.
Like as a father hath compassion upon his children, so hath the Lord compassion on them that fear Him. For He knoweth whereof we are made; He remembereth that we are dust.
As for man, his days are as the grass; as a flower of the field, so shall he flourish.
For when the wind hath passed over it, it shall be gone, and it will know the place thereof no more.
But the mercy of the Lord is from everlasting to everlasting upon them that fear Him.
And His righteousness upon sons of sons, upon such as keep His testament, and remember His commandments to do them.
The Lord hath prepared His throne in heaven, and His kingdom ruleth over all.
Bless the Lord, all ye His angels, mighty in strength, that perform His word, to hearken unto the voice of His words.
Bless ye the Lord, all ye His hosts, ye ministers of His that do His will.
Bless the Lord, all ye works of His, in every place of His dominion. Bless the Lord, O my soul.
Bless the Lord, O my soul. O Lord my God, Thou art become exceeding magnified.
Thou hast put on praise and majesty, Who coverest Thyself with light as with a garment,
Who stretchest out the heavens like a curtain; Who supporteth His chambers in the waters.
Who appointeth the clouds for His ascent; who walketh upon the wings of the wind.
Who maketh His angels spirits, and His ministers a flaming fire.
Who hath established the earth upon its sure foundation; it shall not be moved for ever and ever.
The deep like a garment is his mantle; the waters shall stand upon the mountains.
At Thy rebuke they shall flee; at the voice of Thy thunder they shall be afraid.
The mountains rise up, and the plains go down unto the place which Thou hast founded for them.
Thou hast set a bound that they shall not pass over, neither turn again to cover the earth.
He sendeth the springs into the valleys; the waters shall run among the mountains.
They shall give drink to all the beasts of the field; the wild asses shall wait to quench their thirst.
By them shall the fowls of the air make their habitation; they shall give voice from the midst of the rocks.
He watereth the mountains from His chambers; the earth shall be satisfied with the fruit of Thy works.
He causeth the grass to grow for the cattle, and green herb for the service of men.
That he may bring forth bread out of the earth: and wine maketh glad the heart of man.
To make his face cheerful with oil: and bread strengtheneth man's heart.
The trees of the plain shall be satisfied, the cedars of Lebanon which Thou hast planted.
There shall the sparrows make their nests; the house of the heron is chief among them.
The high mountains are a refuge for the harts, and so is the rock for the hares.
He hath made the moon for seasons; the sun knoweth his going down.
Thou appointedst darkness, and there was night, wherein all the beasts of the forest shall go abroad.
Young lions roaring after their prey, and seeking their meat from God.
The sun ariseth, and they are gathered together, and they shall lay them down in their dens.
But man shall go forth unto his work, and to his labour until the evening.
O Lord, how magnified are Thy works! In wisdom hast Thou made them all; the earth is filled with Thy creation.
So is this great and wide sea, wherein are things creeping innumerable, creatures small and great.
There go the ships, there this dragon, whom Thou hast made to play therein.
All things look unto Thee, that Thou mayest give them their meat in due season.
When Thou givest it them, they shall gather it; when Thou openest Thine hand, all things shall be filled with goodness.
When Thou turnest away Thy face, they shall be troubled; Thou shalt take away their breath, and they shall fail, and return to their dust.
Thou shalt send forth Thy Spirit, and they shall be created, and Thou shalt renew the face of the earth.
Let the glory of the Lord endure unto the ages; the Lord shall rejoice in His works.
He looketh upon the earth, and maketh it tremble; He toucheth the mountains, and they smoke.
I will sing unto the Lord as long as I live, I will sing praise to my God while I have my being.
Let my words be pleasing unto Him; and I will be glad in the Lord.
O that sinners might be consumed out of the earth, and the workers of iniquity, so that they be no more. Bless thou the Lord, O my soul.
Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit, both now and ever, and unto the ages of ages. Amen. Alleluia, alleluia, alleluia, glory to Thee, O God. Alleluia, alleluia, alleluia, glory to Thee, O God. Alleluia, alleluia, alleluia, glory to thee, O God. Lord, have mercy; Lord, have mercy; Lord, have mercy;
Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit, both now and ever, and unto the ages of ages. Amen.
O give thanks unto the Lord, and call upon His name; declare His deeds among the nations.
Glory ye in His holy name; let the heart of them rejoice that seek the Lord.
Seek the Lord, and be strengthened; seek His face at all times.
Remember His marvellous works that He hath done; His wonders, and the judgments of His mouth.
O ye seed of Abraham His servant, ye sons of Jacob His chosen.
He is the Lord our God; His judgments are in all the earth.
He hath remembered His covenant for ever, the word which He commanded to a thousand generations;
Which He made with Abraham, and His oath unto Isaac.
And confirmed the same unto Jacob for a law, and to Israel for an everlasting covenant.
Saying, Unto thee will I give the land of Canaan, the lot of your inheritance.
When they were but few in number, very few, and sojourners therein.
And they went from one nation to another, and from one kingdom to another people.
He suffered no man to do them wrong; yea, He reproved kings for their sake;
Saying, Touch not Mine anointed, and do My prophets no evil.
Moreover He called for a famine upon the land; He brake the whole staff of bread.
He sent a man before them, even Joseph, who was sold for a slave.
Whose feet they humbled with fetters; his life was spent in irons, until his word came to pass.
The word of the Lord tried him; the king sent and loosed him, even the ruler of the people, and let him go free.
He made him lord of his house, and ruler of all his substance;
To instruct his princes as himself, and teach his elders wisdom.
Israel also came into Egypt, and Jacob sojourned in the land of Ham.
And He increased His people greatly, and made them stronger than their enemies.
He turned their heart to hate His people, and to deal subtilly with His servants.
He sent Moses His servant, and Aaron whom He had chosen.
He established the words of His signs among them, and His wonders in the land of Ham.
He sent darkness, and made it dark; for they were embittered against His words.
He turned their waters into blood, and slew their fish.
Their land brought forth frogs in abundance, in the inner chambers of their kings.
He spake, and the dog fly came, and gnats in all their coasts.
He gave them hail for rain, and flaming fire in their land.
He smote their vines also and their fig trees, and brake all the trees of their coasts.
He spake, and the locust came, and the caterpiller, and that without number,
And did eat up all the grass in their land, and devoured all the fruit of their land.
He smote also all the firstborn in their land, the first fruits of all their labour.
He brought them forth also with silver and gold, and there was not one feeble person among their tribes.
Egypt was glad when they departed, for the fear of them fell upon them.
He spread a cloud for a covering for them, and fire to give them light in the night.
They asked, and the quail came; and He satisfied them with the bread of heaven.
He clave the rock, and the waters gushed out; the rivers ran in dry places.
For He remembered His holy promise, which He had spoken unto Abraham His servant.
And He brought forth His people with exultation, and His chosen with gladness.
And He gave them the lands of the heathen, and they inherited the labours of the peoples.
That they might observe His statutes, and diligently seek His law.
O give thanks unto the Lord, for He is good; for His mercy endureth for ever.
Who shall utter the mighty acts of the Lord? Who shall make all His praises to be heard?
Blessed are they that keep judgment, and do righteousness at all times.
Remember us, O Lord, with Thy favour that Thou bearest untor Thy people; O visit us with Thy salvation.
That we may see the good of Thy chosen, that we may be glad in the gladness of Thy nation, that we may glory with Thine inheritance.
We have sinned with our fathers, we have committed iniquity, we have done unrighteously.
Our fathers understood not Thy wonders in Egypt, and they remembered not the multitude of Thy mercy; but provoked Thee as they went up by the Red Sea.
Nevertheless He saved them for His name's sake, that He might make His mighty power to be known.
He rebuked the Red Sea also, and it was dried up; so He led them into the depths, as in a wilderness.
And He saved them from the hand of him that hated them, and redeemed them from the hand of the enemy.
The waters covered those that afflicted them; there was not one of them left.
Then believed they His words, and sang His praise.
They made haste, they forgat His works, they waited not for His counsel;
But lusted exceedingly in the wilderness, and tempted God in the place without water.
And He gave them their request, and sent fulness into their souls.
They provoked Moses also in the camp, and Aaron, the holy one of the Lord.
The earth opened and swallowed up Dathan, and covered the company of Abiram.
And a fire was kindled in their company; a flame burned up the wicked.
And they made a calf in Horeb, and worshipped the graven thing.
Thus they changed His glory into the likeness of a calf that eateth grass.
And they forgat God who had saved them, who had done great things in Egypt,
Wondrous works in the land of Ham, terrible things at the Red Sea.
And He said that He would destroy them, had not Moses His chosen stood before Him in the breach, to turn away His wrath, lest He should destroy them.
Yea, they despised the desirable land; they believed not His word;
But murmured in their tents; they hearkened not unto the voice of the Lord.
Therefore He lifted up His hand against them, to overthrow them in the wilderness; to overthrow their seed also among the nations, and to scatter them in the lands.
They were made initiates also of Baalpeor, and ate the sacrifices of the dead.
And they provoked Him to anger with their inventions, and destruction was multiplied among them.
And Phinehas stood up and made propitiation, and the plague abated. And that was counted to him for righteousness, from generation to generation for evermore.
They provoked Him also at the waters of strife, and Moses was hurt for their sakes.
Because they provoked his spirit, and he spake unadvisedly with his lips.
They did not destroy the nations, concerning whom the Lord commanded them;
But were mingled among the heathen, and learned their works; and they served their graven things, and it became a scandal unto them.
Yea, they sacrificed their sons and their daughters unto demons, and shed innocent blood, even the blood of their sons and of their daughters, whom they sacrificed unto the graven things of Canaan.
And the land was murderously defiled with blood, and it was polluted with their own works, and they went a whoring with their own inventions.
Therefore was the wrath of the Lord kindled against His people, and He abhorred His own inheritance.
And He gave them into the hands of their enemies, and they that hated them had dominion over them.
Their enemies also afflicted them, and they were brought into subjection under their hand.
Many times did He deliver them, but they provoked Him with their counsel, and were brought low in their iniquities.
Nevertheless the Lord regarded them in their affliction, and heard their supplication.
And He remembered His covenant, and repented according to the multitude of His mercy.
He made them to be pitied in the sight of all those that had taken them captive.
Save us, O Lord our God, and gather us from among the heathen, that we may give thanks to Thy holy name, that we may glory in Thy praise.
Blessed be the God of Israel, from everlasting to everlasting; and all the peoples shall say, So be it, so be it.
O give thanks unto the Lord, for He is good; for His mercy endureth for ever.
Let them that have been redeemed of the Lord say so, whom He hath redeemed from the hand of the enemy, and gathered them out of the lands: from the east, and from the west, and from the north, and from the sea.
They wandered in the wilderness, in a waterless land; they found not the way to a city of habitation.
Hungry and thirsty, their soul fainted in them.
And they cried unto the Lord in their affliction, and He delivered them out of their distresses.
And He led them forth into the right way, that they might go to a city of habitation.
Let them praise the Lord for His mercies, and for His wonderful works to the sons of men.
For He hath satisfied the empty soul, and filled the hungry soul with goodness.
Such as sit in darkness and in the shadow of death, bound in poverty and iron,
Because they rebelled against the words of God, and provoked the counsel of the Most High.
Their heart also was brought down with labours; they waxed feeble, and there was none to help.
And they cried unto the Lord in their affliction, and He saved them out of their distresses.
And He brought them out of darkness, and the shadow of death; and brake their bonds asunder.
Let them praise the Lord for His mercies, and for His wonderful works to the sons of men.
For He hath broken in pieces the gates of brass, and shattered the bars of iron.
He helped them out of the way of their transgressions, for they were brought low because of their iniquities.
Their soul abhorred all manner of food, and they drew near unto the gates of death.
And they cried unto the Lord in their affliction, and He saved them out of their distresses.
He sent his Word, and healed them, and delivered them from their corruption.
Let them praise the Lord for His mercies, and for His wonderful works to the sons of men.
And let them sacrifice to Him a sacrifice of praise, and declare His works with rejoicing.
They that go down to the sea in ships, that do business in great waters;
These men have seen the works of the Lord, and His wonders in the deep.
He spake the word, and a stormy wind arose; and the waves thereof were lifted up.
They mount up to the heavens, and they go down into the depths; their soul was melted away with evils.
They were troubled, and they staggered as a drunken man; and all their wisdom was swallowed up.
And they cried unto the Lord in their affliction, and He brought them out of their distresses.
And He commanded the storm, and it was calmed into a breeze, and the waves thereof fell silent.
And they were glad, because they were stilled; and He guided them to the haven of His will.
Let them praise the Lord for His mercies, and for His wonderful works to the sons of men.
Let them exalt Him in the congregation of the people, and praise Him in the seat of the elders.
He hath turned rivers into a wilderness, and the streams of waters into dry ground;
A fruitful land into saltness, for the wickedness of them that dwell therein.
He turned a wilderness into pools of waters, and a parched land into streams of waters.
And there He made the hungry to dwell, and they prepared cities for habitation,
And they sowed fields, and planted vineyards, which yielded fruits of increase.
He blessed them also, so that they were multiplied greatly; and He suffered not their cattle to decrease.
And again, they were minished and brought low through affliction, evils, and sorrows.
Contempt was poured upon their princes; and He caused them to wander in a wilderness, where there is no way.
Yea, He helped the poor out of his poverty, and made his families like a flock.
The upright shall see it, and be glad, and all iniquity shall stop her mouth.
Who is wise, and will keep these things, and will understand the mercies of the Lord?
O God, my heart is ready, my heart is ready; I will sing and give praise with my glory.
Awake, my glory; awake, psaltery and harp: I myself will awake right early.
I will praise Thee, O Lord, among the peoples; I will sing praise to Thee among the nations.
For Thy mercy is great above the heavens, and Thy truth even to the clouds.
Be Thou exalted, O God, above the heavens, and Thy glory above all the earth.
That Thy beloved may be delivered, save with Thy right hand, and hear Thou me.
God hath spoken in his holy one, I will be exalted, and divide Shechem, and measure out the valley of tabernacles.
Gilead is Mine, and Manasseh is Mine; Ephraim also is the strength of My head, Judah is My king.
Moab is the cauldron of My hope, over Edom will I stretch out My shoe; the strangers are made subject unto Me.
Who will lead me into a fortified city? Or who will lead me into Edom?
Wilt not Thou, O God, Who hast cast us off? And wilt not Thou, O God, go forth with our hosts?
Give us help from trouble, for vain is the salvation of man.
Through God shall we do mightily; and He shall bring our enemies to nought.
O God, pass not over my praise in silence, for the mouth of the sinner and the mouth of the deceitful are opened against me.
They have spoken against me with a deceitful tongue, they have compassed me about also with words of hatred, and fought against me without a cause.
In return for my love they falsely accused me; but I gave myself unto prayer.
And they rewarded me evil for good, and hatred for my love.
Set Thou a sinner over him, and let the devil stand at his right hand.
When he is judged, let him go forth condemned, and let his prayer become sin.
Let his days be few, and let another take his office.
Let his children be fatherless, and his wife a widow.
Let his children be vagabonds without a dwelling place, and let them beg; let them be cast out of their ruined habitations.
Let his creditor search out all his substance, and let strangers spoil all his labours.
Let there be none to help him, nor anyone to have pity upon his fatherless children.
Let his children be given over to destruction; in one generation let his name be blotted out.
Let the iniquity of his fathers be remembered before the Lord, and let not the sin of his mother be blotted out.
Let them be before the Lord continually, and let the memory of them perish from the earth.
Because he remembered not to shew mercy, but persecuted the poor and needy, and one broken in heart, that he might slay him.
And he loved cursing, and it shall come upon him; and he delighted not in blessing, and it shall be far from him.
And he put on cursing like a garment, and it came into his bowels like water, and like oil into his bones.
Let it be to him as a garment wherewith he is clothed, and like a girdle wherewith he is girded continually.
This is the dealing of the Lord with them that slander me, and with them that speak evil against my soul.
But deal Thou for me, O Lord, Lord, for Thy name's sake, for Thy mercy is good.
Deliver Thou me, for I am poor and needy, and my heart is troubled within me.
I am taken away like a shadow when it declineth; I am shaken off as the locusts.
My knees are grown weak through fasting, and my flesh is changed for want of oil.
I am become a reproach also to them; they looked upon me, and they shaked their heads.
Help me, O Lord my God, and save me according to Thy mercy.
And let them know that this is Thy hand, and that Thou, O Lord, hast done it.
They shall curse, but Thou shalt bless; let them be ashamed that rise up against me; but Thy servant shall be glad.
Let them that slander me be clothed with confusion, and let them be covered with shame, as with a double mantle.
I will greatly praise the Lord with my mouth; yea, I will praise Him among the multitude.
For He hath stood at the right hand of the poor, to save my soul from them that persecute me.
The Lord said unto my Lord, Sit Thou at my right hand, until I make Thine enemies Thy footstool.
The Lord shall send Thee a rod of power out of Zion; rule Thou in the midst of Thine enemies.
With Thee is dominion in the day of Thy power, in the splendour of Thy saints.
From the womb before the morning star have I begotten Thee.
The Lord hath sworn, and will not repent, Thou art a priest for ever after the order of Melchizedek.
The Lord at Thy right hand hath crushed kings in the day of His wrath.
He shall judge among the nations, He shall fill them up with the dead bodies; He shall crush the heads of many upon the earth.
He shall drink of the brook in the way; therefore shall He lift up his head.
I will give Thee thanks, O Lord, with my whole heart, in the assembly of the upright, and in the congregation.
Great are the works of the Lord, sought out in all that He hath willed.
His work is thanksgiving and majesty, and His righteousness endureth for ever and ever.
He hath made His wonderful works to be remembered; the Lord is merciful and full of compassion.
He hath given food unto them that fear Him; He will ever be mindful of His covenant.
He hath shewed His people the power of His works, that He may give them the heritage of the heathen.
The works of His hands are verity and judgment; all His commandments are sure, made fast for ever and ever, done in truth and uprightness.
He sent redemption to His people, He hath commanded His covenant for ever; holy and terrible is His name.
The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom, and a good understanding have all they that do accordingly.
His praise endureth for ever and ever.
Blessed is the man that feareth the Lord; he shall delight greatly in His commandments.
His seed shall be mighty upon earth; the generation of the upright shall be blessed.
Glory and riches shall be in his house, and his righteousness endureth for ever and ever.
Unto the upright there hath arisen light in the darkness; he is merciful, and full of compassion, and righteous.
A good man is he that sheweth compassion, and lendeth; he will order his words with discretion, for he shall not be moved for ever.
The righteous shall be in everlasting remembrance; he shall not be afraid of evil tidings; his heart is ready to hope in the Lord.
His heart is established, he shall not be afraid, until he see his desire upon his enemies.
He hath dispersed, he hath given to the poor; his righteousness endureth for ever and ever; his horn shall be exalted with glory.
The sinner shall see it, and be angry; he shall gnash with his teeth and melt away; the desire of the sinner shall perish.
Praise the Lord, ye servants; praise the name of the Lord.
Blessed be the name of the Lord, from this time forth and for evermore.
From the rising of the sun to the going down of the same, the Lord's name is to be praised.
The Lord is high above all nations; His glory is above the heavens.
Who is like unto the Lord our God,
Who dwelleth on high, and beholdeth the things that are lowly in heaven, and in the earth?
Who raiseth up the poor from the earth, and lifteth the needy out of the dunghill,
That He may set him with princes, even with the princes of His people.
Who maketh the barren woman to dwell in a house, a mother rejoicing over children.
When Israel went out of Egypt, the house of Jacob from
among a barbarous people,
Judah was His sanctuary, and Israel His dominion.
The sea saw it, and fled; Jordan was turned back.
The mountains skipped like rams, and the hills like lambs.
What ailed thee, O sea, that thou fleddest? and thou, Jordan, that thou wast turned back?
Ye mountains, that ye skipped like rams, and ye hills, like lambs?
The earth trembled at the presence of the Lord, at the presence of the God of Jacob.
Who turneth the rock into pools of water, and the sharp rock into fountains of water.
Not unto us, Lord, not unto us, but unto Thy name give glory, for Thy mercy and truth's sake.
Lest the heathen say, Where is their God?
But our God is in heaven and on earth; He hath done whatsoever He willed.
The idols of the heathen are of silver and gold, the work of men's hands.
They have a mouth, but they shall not speak; they have eyes, but they see not.
They have ears, but they hear not; noses have they, but they smell not.
They have hands, but they handle not; feet have they, but they walk not; neither speak they through their throat.
Let those that make them become like unto them; yea, all such as put their trust in them.
The house of Israel hath hoped in the Lord; He is their help and their defender.
The house of Aaron hath hoped in the Lord; He is their help and their defender.
They that fear the Lord have hoped in the Lord; He is their help and their defender.
The Lord hath been mindful of us, and hath blessed us; He hath blessed the house of Israel, He hath blessed the house of Aaron.
He hath blessed them that fear the Lord, both small and great.
The Lord increase you, you and your children.
Ye are blessed of the Lord, Which made heaven and earth.
The heaven of heavens is the Lord's, but the earth hath He given to the sons of men.
The dead shall not praise Thee, O Lord, nor any that go down into Hades.
But we who live will bless the Lord, from this time forth and for evermore.
I am filled with love, for the Lord will hear the voice of my supplication.
For He hath inclined His ear to me, and I will call upon Him as long as I live.
The pangs of death compassed me, and the perils of Hades came upon me. I found trouble and sorrow, and I called upon the name of the Lord: O Lord, deliver my soul.
Merciful is the Lord, and righteous; yea, our God is merciful.
The Lord preserveth the infants; I was brought low, and He saved me.
Return unto thy rest, O my soul, for the Lord hath dealt bountifully with thee.
For He hath delivered my soul from death, mine eyes from tears, and my feet from falling.
I will be well pleasing before the Lord in the land of the living.
I believed, and therefore have I spoken; I was greatly
humbled.
I said in mine ecstacy, Every man is a liar.
What shall I render unto the Lord for all that He hath rendered unto me?
I will take the cup of salvation, and call upon the name of the Lord.
I will pay my vows unto the Lord, in the presence of all His people.
Precious in the sight of the Lord is the death of His saints.
O Lord, I am Thy servant; I am Thy servant, and the son of Thine handmaid; Thou hast broken my bonds in sunder.
I will sacrifice to Thee a sacrifice of praise, and will call upon the name of the Lord.
I will pay my vows unto the Lord in the presence of all His people, in the courts of the Lord's house, in the midst of thee, O Jerusalem.
O praise the Lord, all ye nations; praise Him, all ye peoples.
For He hath made His mercy to prevail over us, and the truth of the Lord endureth for ever.
O give thanks unto the Lord, for He is good; for His mercy endureth for ever.
Let the house of Israel now say that He is good, for His mercy endureth for ever.
Let the house of Aaron now say that He is good, for His mercy endureth for ever.
Let all that fear the Lord now say that He is good, for His mercy endureth for ever.
I called upon the Lord out of my trouble, and the Lord heard me, and set me at large.
The Lord is my helper, and I will not fear what man shall do unto me.
The Lord is my help, and I shall see my desire upon mine enemies.
It is better to trust in the Lord than to trust in man.
It is better to hope in the Lord than to hope in princes.
All the nations compassed me about, but in the name of the Lord I warded them off.
They compassed me, yea, they compassed me about; but in the name of the Lord I warded them off.
They compassed me about, like bees around a honeycomb, and they kindled like fire among thorns; but in the name of the Lord I warded them off.
I was thrust, and overturned, that I might fall; but the Lord was quick to help me.
The Lord is my strength and my song, and is become my salvation.
The voice of rejoicing and salvation is in the tabernacles of the righteous.
The right hand of the Lord hath wrought mightily, the right hand of the Lord hath exalted me; the right hand of the Lord hath wrought mightily.
I shall not die, but live, and declare the works of the Lord.
The Lord hath chastened me sore, but He hath not given me over unto death.
Open to me the gates of righteousness, and I will go in by them, and I will praise the Lord.
This is the gate of the Lord; the just shall enter thereby.
I will praise Thee, for Thou hast heard me, and art become my salvation.
The stone which the builder rejected is become the head stone of the corner.
This is the Lord's doing, and it is marvellous in our eyes.
This is the day which the Lord hath made; let us rejoice and be glad in it.
Save now, O Lord; O Lord, send now prosperity.
Blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord; we have blessed you out of the house of the Lord.
God is the Lord, and hath appeared unto us; appoint a feast with thick boughs, even to the horns of the altar.
Thou art my God, and I will praise Thee; Thou art my God, and I will exalt Thee; I will praise Thee, for Thou hast heard me, and art become my salvation.
O give thanks unto the Lord, for He is good; for His mercy endureth for ever.
Blessed are they that are blameless in the way, who walk in the law of the Lord.
Blessed are they that search out His testimonies; they shall seek Him with their whole heart.
For they that work iniquity have not walked in His ways.
Thou hast commanded us to keep Thy commandments most diligently.
O that my ways may be directed to keep Thy statutes!
Then shall I not be ashamed, when I have respect unto all Thy commandments.
I will praise Thee with uprightness of heart, when I shall have learned the judgments of Thy righteousness.
I will keep Thy statutes; O forsake me not utterly.
Wherewithal shall a young man correct his way? by keeping Thy words.
With my whole heart have I sought Thee; cast me not away from Thy commandments.
Thy words have I hid in my heart, that I might not sin against Thee.
Blessed art Thou, O Lord; teach me Thy statutes.
With my lips have I declared all the judgments of Thy mouth.
I have had delight in the way of Thy testimonies, as much as in all riches.
I will meditate in Thy commandments, and understand Thy ways.
I will meditate in Thy statutes; I will not forget Thy words.
Give recompense unto Thy servant; quicken Thou me, and I shall keep Thy words.
Uncover Thou mine eyes, and I shall behold wondrous things out of Thy law.
I am a sojourner upon the earth; hide not Thy commandments from me.
My soul hath longed to desire Thy judgments at all times.
Thou hast rebuked the proud; cursed are they which do err from Thy commandments.
Remove from me reproach and contempt, for I have sought Thy testimonies.
For princes did sit and speak against me, but Thy servant did meditate in Thy statutes.
For Thy testimonies are my meditation, and Thy statutes are my counsels.
My soul hath cleaved unto the ground; quicken Thou me according to Thy word.
I have declared my ways, and Thou heardest me; teach me Thy statutes.
Make me to understand the way of Thy statutes, and I will meditate upon Thy wondrous works.
My soul hath slumbered for heaviness; strengthen Thou me in Thy words.
Remove from me the way of unrighteousness, and have mercy upon me with Thy law.
I have chosen the way of truth, and have not forgotten Thy judgments.
I have cleaved unto Thy testimonies; O Lord, put me not to shame.
I have run the way of Thy commandments, when Thou didst enlarge my heart.
Set before me for a law, O Lord, the way of Thy statutes; and I shall seek it out continually.
Give me understanding, and I shall search Thy law; yea, I will observe it with my whole heart.
Guide me in the path of Thy commandments, for I have longed for it.
Incline my heart unto Thy testimonies, and not to covetousness.
Turn away my eyes, that I behold not vanity; quicken Thou me in Thy way.
Stablish Thy word unto Thy servant, in fear of Thee.
Take away my reproach, which I have feared, for Thy judgments are good.
Behold, I have longed after Thy commanments; quicken me in Thy righteousness.
Let Thy mercy come also upon me, O Lord, even Thy salvation according to Thy word.
So shall I make answer to them that reproach me, for I have hoped in Thy words.
And take not Thou the word of truth utterly out of my mouth, for I have hoped in Thy judgments.
So shall I keep Thy law continually for ever and ever.
And I walked at liberty, for I sought Thy commandments.
I spake of Thy testimonies also before kings, and was not ashamed.
And I meditated in Thy commandments, which I have greatly loved.
My hands also have I lifted up unto Thy commandments, which I have loved; and I meditated in Thy statutes.
Remember Thy words unto Thy servant, upon which Thou hast caused me to hope.
This hath comforted me in my humiliation, for Thy word hath quickened me.
The proud have transgressed exceedingly, yet have I not declined from Thy law.
I remembered Thy judgments of old, O Lord, and was comforted.
Despondency hath taken hold upon me, because of the sinners who forsake Thy law.
Thy statutes have been my songs in the place of my sojourning.
I have remembered Thy name, in the night, O Lord, and have kept Thy law.
This happened to me, because I diligently sought Thy statutes.
Thou art my portion, O Lord; I have said that I would keep Thy law.
I entreated Thy face with my whole heart; have mercy upon me according to Thy word.
I have thought on Thy ways, and turned my feet unto Thy testimonies.
I made ready, and was not troubled, that I might keep Thy commandments.
The cords of sinners have compassed me, but I have not forgotten Thy law.
At midnight I rose to give thanks unto Thee, because of the judgments of Thy righteousness.
I am a companion of all them that fear Thee, and of them that keep Thy statutes.
The earth, O Lord, is full of Thy mercy; teach me Thy statutes.
Thou hast dealt graciously with Thy servant, O Lord, according to Thy word.
Teach me goodness and discipline and knowledge, for I have believed Thy commandments.
Before I was humbled, I went astray; therefore have I kept Thy word.
Thou art good, O Lord, and in Thy goodness teach me Thy statutes.
The unrighteousness of the proud is multiplied against me, but I will search Thy commandments with my whole heart.
Their heart is curdled like milk, but I have meditated in Thy law.
It is good for me that Thou hast humbled me, that I might learn Thy statutes.
The law of Thy mouth is better to me than thousands of gold and silver.
Thy hands have made me and fashioned me; O give me understanding, and I shall learn Thy commandments.
They that fear Thee shall see me, and be glad; for I have hoped in Thy words.
I have known, O Lord, that Thy judgments are right, and with truth Thou hast humbled me.
O let Thy mercy now be for my comfort, according to Thy word unto Thy servant.
Let Thy tender mercies come unto me, and I shall live; for Thy law is my meditation.
Let the proud be ashamed, for they have transgressed against me unjustly; but I will meditate in Thy commandments.
Let those that fear Thee return unto me, and those that know Thy testimonies.
Let my heart be blameless in Thy statutes, that I be not ashamed.
My soul fainteth for Thy salvation; I have hoped in Thy words.
Mine eyes have failed with waiting for Thy word, saying, O when wilt Thou comfort me?
For I am become like a wineskin in the frost, yet I have not forgotten Thy statutes.
How many are the days of Thy servant? When wilt Thou execute judgment for me on them that persecute me?
Transgressors have told me idle tales, but they are not after Thy law, O Lord.
All Thy commandments are truth: they have persecuted me wrongfully; help Thou me.
They had almost made an end of me upon earth, but I forsook not Thy commandments.
Quicken me according to Thy mercy, and I will keep the testimonies of Thy mouth.
For ever, O Lord, Thy word endureth in heaven.
Thy truth is from generation to generation; Thou hast established the earth, and it abideth.
The day continueth according to Thine ordinance; for all things are Thy servants.
If Thy law had not been my meditation, then I should have perished in my humiliation.
I will never forget Thy statutes, for in them Thou hast quickened me.
MIDDLE
I am Thine, O save me; for I have sought Thy statutes.
Sinners have waited for me to destroy me, but I have understood Thy testimonies.
I have seen an end of all perfection; Thy commandment is exceeding broad.
O how have I loved Thy law, O Lord! It is my meditation all the day long.
Thou through Thy commandment hast made me wiser than mine enemies, for it is mine for ever.
I have more understanding than all my teachers, for Thy testimonies are my meditation.
I have more understanding than mine elders, because sought Thy commandments.
I have refrained my feet from every evil way, that I might keep Thy words.
I have not departed from Thy judgments, for Thou hast appointed a law for me.
How sweet are Thy words unto my throat! yea, sweeter than honey to my mouth.
From Thy commandments have I gained understanding; therefore I have hated every unrighteous way.
Thy law is a lamp unto my feet, and a light unto my paths.
I have sworn, and am steadfastly purposed, that I will keep the judgments of Thy righteousness.
I have been humbled very much; quicken me, O Lord, according unto Thy word.
Be pleased with the freewill offerings of my mouth, O Lord, and teach me Thy judgments.
My soul is continually in Thy hands, yet I have not forgotten Thy law.
Sinners have laid a snare for me, yet I erred not from Thy commandments.
Thy testimonies have I taken as an heritage for ever, for they are the joy of my heart.
I have inclined my heart to perform Thy statutes for ever, for a recompense.
I have hated transgressors, but Thy law have I loved.
Thou art my helper and defender; I have hoped in Thy words.
Depart from me, ye evildoers, and I will search out the commandments of my God.
Hold Thou me up according to Thy word, and quicken me; and turn me not away in shame from mine expectation.
Help me, and I shall be saved; and I will meditate in Thy statutes continually.
Thou hast despised all them that depart from Thy statutes, for their inward thought is unrighteous.
I have accounted as transgressors all the sinners of the earth; therefore have I loved Thy testimonies.
Nail down my flesh with the fear of Thee, for I am afraid of Thy judgments.
I have done judgment and justice; give me not over unto them that wrong me.
Receive Thy servant unto good; let not the proud accuse me falsely.
Mine eyes have failed with waiting for Thy salvation, and for the word of Thy righteousness.
Deal with Thy servant according to Thy mercy, and teach me Thy statutes.
I am Thy servant; give me understanding, and I shall know Thy testimonies.
It is time for the Lord to act, for they have made void Thy law.
Therefore have I loved Thy commandments above gold and topaz.
Therefore have I directed myself according to all Thy commandments; I have hated every unrighteous way.
Thy testimonies are wonderful; therefore hath my soul sought them.
The unfolding of Thy words shall give light and understanding unto infants.
I opened my mouth, and drew in my breath; for I longed for Thy commandments.
Look Thou upon me, and be merciful unto me, according to the judgment of them that love Thy name.
Order my steps according to Thy word, and let not any iniquity have dominion over me.
Deliver me from the false accusation of men, and I will keep Thy commandments.
Make Thy face to shine upon Thy servant, and teach me Thy statutes.
Mine eyes have sent forth streams of waters, because I kept not Thy law.
Righteous art Thou, O Lord, and upright are Thy judgments.
Thy testimonies that Thou hast commanded are very righteousness and truth.
My zeal for Thee hath made me to pine away, because mine enemies have forgotten Thy words.
Thy word hath been tried in the fire to the uttermost, and Thy servant hath loved it.
I am young and despised, yet have I not forgotten Thy statutes.
Thy righteousness is an everlasting righteousness, and Thy law is truth.
Troubles and anguish are come upon me, yet Thy commandments are my meditation.
Thy testimonies are righteousness for ever; give me understanding, and I shall live.
I cried with my whole heart; hear me, O Lord, and I shall seek Thy statutes.
I cried unto Thee; save me, and I shall keep Thy testimonies.
I arose before the dawn, and cried; I hoped in Thy words.
Mine eyes awoke before the morning, that I might meditate in Thy words.
Hear my voice according to Thy mercy, O Lord; quicken me according to Thy judgment.
They have drawn nigh that persecute me unlawfully; they are far from Thy law.
Thou art near, O Lord, and all Thy ways are truth.
Concerning Thy testimonies have I known of old that Thou hast founded them for ever.
Consider my humiliation, and deliver me; for I have not forgotten Thy law.
Judge Thou my cause, and redeem me; quicken me for Thy word's sake.
Salvation is far from sinners, for they have not sought Thy statutes.
Many are Thy tender mercies, O Lord; quicken me according to Thy judgment.
Many are they that persecute me and afflict me, yet have I not turned aside from Thy testimonies.
I beheld men acting foolishly, and pined away; because they kept not Thy words.
Behold how I have loved Thy commandments; quicken me, O Lord, in Thy mercy.
The beginning of Thy words is truth, and all the judgments of Thy righteousness endure for ever.
Princes have persecuted me without a cause, and my heart hath been afraid because of Thy words.
I will rejoice at Thy words, as one that findeth great spoil.
I have hated and abhorred unrightousness, but Thy law have I loved.
Seven times a day have I praised Thee because of the judgments of Thy righteousness.
Much peace have they that love Thy law, and for them there is no stumbling block.
Lord, I have awaited Thy salvation, and loved Thy commandments.
My soul hath kept Thy testimonies, and loved them exceedingly.
I have kept Thy commandments and Thy testimonies, for all my ways are before Thee, O Lord.
Let my supplication come near before Thee, O Lord; give me understanding according to Thy word.

My tongue shall speak of Thy words, for all Thy commandments are righteousness.
Let Thy hand be near to save me, for I have chosen Thy commandments.
I have longed for Thy salvation, O Lord; and Thy law is my meditation.
My soul shall live, and shall praise Thee; and Thy judgments shall help me.
I have gone astray like a lost sheep; seek Thy servant, for I have not forgotten Thy commandments.
In mine affliction I cried to the Lord; and He heard me.
O Lord, deliver my soul from unrighteous lips, and from a deceitful tongue.
What shall be given unto thee, or what shall be added unto thee, for thy deceitful tongue?
Sharpened arrows of the mighty with coals that lay waste.
Woe is me, that my sojourn is prolonged; I have dwelt with the tents of Kedar; my soul hath long been a sojourner.
With them that hated peace I was peaceable; when I spake unto them, they made war against me without a cause.
I have lifted up mine eyes to the mountains, from whence cometh my help.
My help cometh from the Lord, Which made heaven and earth.
Let not thy foot be moved, and let not Him that keepeth thee slumber.
Behold, He that keepeth Israel shall neither slumber nor sleep.
The Lord shall keep thee; the Lord is thy shelter upon thy right hand.
The sun shall not burn thee by day, neither the moon by night.
The Lord shall preserve thee from all evil; the Lord shall preserve thy soul.
The Lord shall preserve thy coming in and thy going out, from this time forth, and even for evermore.
I was glad because of them that said to me, Let us go into
the house of the Lord.
Our feet have stood within thy courts, O Jerusalem.
Jerusalem is builded as a city that is compact together.
For thither the tribes went up, the tribes of the Lord, a testimony for Israel, to give thanks unto the name of the Lord.
For there are set thrones for judgment, thrones for the house of David.
Ask now for the things which are for the peace of Jerusalem, and for the prosperity of them that love thee.
Let peace be with thy strength, and prosperity within thy palaces.
For my brethren and companions' sakes, I spake peace concerning thee.
Because of the house of the Lord our God, I have sought good things for thee.
Unto Thee have I lifted up mine eyes, O Thou that dwellest in the heavens.
Behold, as the eyes of servants look unto the hand of their masters, as the eyes of a handmaiden look unto the hands of her mistress, so look our eyes unto the Lord our God, until that He have mercy upon us.
Have mercy upon us, O Lord, have mercy upon us, for we are utterly filled with abasement. Our soul hath been exceedingly filled therewith; let reproach come upon those that prosper, and abasement upon the proud.
If it had not been that the Lord was with us, let now Israel say; if it had not been that the Lord was with us, when men rose up against us; then they had swallowed us up alive.
When their wrath was kindled against us, then the waters had overwhelmed us.
Our soul had passed through the torrent; then had our soul passed through the overwhelming water.
Blessed be the Lord, who hath not given us as a prey to their teeth.
Our soul is delivered, as a sparrow out of the snare of the hunters.
The snare is broken, and we are delivered.
Our help is in the name of the Lord, Who made heaven and earth.
They that trust in the Lord shall be as Mount Zion; he that dwelleth in Jerusalem shall never be moved.
The mountains are round about her; so the Lord is round about His people, from henceforth, and for evermore.
For the Lord shall not suffer the rod of sinners to rest upon the lot of the righteous, lest the righteous put forth their hand unto iniquities.
Do good, O Lord, unto those that be good, and to them that are upright in their heart.
As for such as turn aside to crooked ways, the Lord shall lead them away with the workers of iniquity. Peace be upon Israel.
When the Lord turned again the captivity of Zion, we became like them that are comforted.
Then was our mouth was filled with joy, and our tongue with exultation.
Then shall they say among the heathen, The Lord hath done great things for them.
The Lord hath done great things for us, and we are glad.
Turn again our captivity, O Lord, as the streams in the south.
They that sow in tears shall reap in joy.
They went on and wept, as they cast their seed.
But they shall come with rejoicing, bringing their sheaves with them.
Except the Lord build the house, they labour in vain that build it. Except the Lord keep the city, he that keepeth it watcheth but in vain.
It is vain for you to rise up early; ye rise up after resting, ye that eat the bread of sorrow,
While He hath given his beloved sleep. Lo, children are an heritage of the Lord, the reward of the fruit of the womb.
As arrows in the hands of a mighty man, so are the children of those that were outcast.
Blessed is the man that shall satisfy his desire with them; they shall not be ashamed when they speak with their enemies in the gates.
Blessed are all they that fear the Lord, that walk in His ways.
Thou shalt eat the fruit of thy labours; blessed art thou, and it shall be well with thee.
Thy wife shall be as a fruitful vine by the sides of thy house; thy children like olive plants round about thy table.
Behold, thus shall the man be blessed that feareth the Lord.
The Lord bless thee out of Zion; and mayest thou see the prosperity of Jerusalem all the days of thy life.
And mayest thou see thy children's children. Peace upon Israel.
Many a time have they fought against me from my youth up, may Israel now say;
Many a time have they fought against me from my youth up; yet they have not prevailed against me.
The sinners wrought upon my back, they prolonged their iniquity.
The Lord is righteous; He hath cut asunder the necks of sinners.
Let them all be ashamed and turned back that hate Zion.
Let them be as the grass upon the housetops, which withereth afore it is uprooted.
Wherewith the reaper filleth not his hand, nor he that gathereth sheaves his bosom.
Neither have they which go by said, The blessing of the Lord be upon you; we have blessed you in the name of the Lord.
Out of the depths have I cried to Thee, O Lord; Lord, hear
my voice.
Let Thine ears be attentive to the voice of my supplication.
If Thou, Lord, shouldest mark iniquities, O Lord, who shall stand?
For there is forgiveness with Thee.
For Thy name's sake have I waited for Thee, O Lord; my soul hath waited for Thy word, my soul hath hoped in the Lord.
From the morning watch until night, from the morning watch, let Israel hope in the Lord.
For with the Lord there is mercy, and with Him is plenteous redemption; and He shall redeem Israel from all his iniquities.
Lord, my heart is not haughty, nor are mine eyes lofty.
Neither have I exercised myself in great matters, or in things too wonderful for me.
If I had not been humble minded, but had exalted my soul, like a child that is weaned from his mother, so wouldest Thou have requited my soul.
Let Israel hope in the Lord, from henceforth, and for ever.
Lord, remember David and all his meekness; how he sware unto the Lord, and vowed unto the God of Jacob.
I will not go into the tabernacle of my house; I will not go up into the couch of my bed;
I will not give sleep to mine eyes, nor slumber to mine eyelids, nor rest to my temples,
Until I find out a place for the Lord, an habitation for the God of Jacob.
Behold, we heard it in Ephratha; we found it in the fields of the wood.
Let us go into His tabernacles; let us worship at the place where His feet have stood.
Arise, O Lord, into Thy rest; Thou, and the ark of Thy holiness.
Thy priests shall be clothed with righteousness, and Thy just shall rejoice.
For Thy servant David's sake turn not away Thy face from Thine anointed.
The Lord hath sworn in truth to David, and He will not annul it,
Of the fruit of thy body will I set upon thy throne,
If thy sons will keep My covenant and these testimonies that I shall teach them, their sons shall also sit upon thy throne for evermore.
For the Lord hath chosen Zion, He hath chosen it for His habitation.
This is My rest for ever and ever; here will I dwell, for I have chosen it.
I will abundantly bless her provision; I will satisfy her poor with bread.
I will clothe her priests with salvation, and her saints shall rejoice with joy.
There will I make to spring forth an horn for David; I have prepared a lamp for Mine anointed.
His enemies will I clothe with shame, but upon himself shall My holiness flourish.
Behold now, what is so good or so pleasant as for brethren to dwell together in unity?
It is like the oil of myrrh upon the head, that runneth down upon the beard, even Aaron's beard, that runneth down to the fringe of his garment.
As the dew of Aermon, that descendeth upon the mountains of Zion: for there the Lord commanded His blessing, even life for evermore.
Behold now, bless ye the Lord, all ye servants of the Lord, which stand in the house of the Lord, in the courts of the house of our God.
Lift up your hands by night unto the sanctuary, and bless the Lord.
The Lord that made heaven and earth bless thee out of Zion.
Praise ye the name of the Lord; O ye servants, praise the Lord,
Ye that stand in the house of the Lord, in the courts of the house of our God.
Praise the Lord, for the Lord is good; sing praises unto His name, for it is good.
For the Lord hath chosen Jacob unto Himself, and Israel for His own possession.
For I know that the Lord is great, and that our Lord is above all gods.
Whatsoever the Lord willed, that hath He done, in heaven, and in earth, in the seas and all deep places.
He bringeth up clouds from the ends of the earth; He made lightnings for the rain; He bringeth winds out of His treasuries.
He smote the firstborn of Egypt, from man unto beast.
He sent signs and wonders into the midst of thee, O Egypt; unto Pharaoh, and unto all his servants.
He smote many nations, and slew mighty kings:
Sihon, king of the Amorites, and Og, the king of Bashan; and all the kingdoms of Canaan.
And gave their lands for an heritage, an heritage unto Israel His people.
Thy name, O Lord, endureth for ever; and Thy memorial from generation to generation.
For the Lord will judge His people, and be entreated concerning His servants.
The idols of the heathen are silver and gold, the work of men's hands.
They have a mouth, but they speak not; eyes have they, but they see not.
They have ears, but they hear not; neither is there any breath in their mouths.
Let those who make them be like unto them, yea, all that trusteth in them.
Bless the Lord, O house of Israel. Bless the Lord, O house of Aaron. Bless the Lord, O house of Levi.
Ye that fear the Lord, bless the Lord.
Blessed be the Lord out of Zion, Who dwelleth at Jerusalem.
O give thanks unto the Lord, for He is good; for His mercy endureth for ever.
O give thanks unto the God of gods; for His mercy endureth for ever.
O give thanks unto the Lord of lords; for His mercy endureth for ever.
To Him Who alone hath done great wonders; for His mercy endureth for ever.
To Him that by wisdom made the heavens; for His mercy endureth for ever.
To Him that established the earth upon the waters; for His mercy endureth for ever.
To Him that alone made great lights; for His mercy endureth for ever.
The sun to rule the day; for His mercy endureth for ever.
The moon and the stars to rule the night; for His mercy endureth for ever.
To Him that smote Egypt in their firstborn; for His mercy endureth for ever.
And brought out Israel from among them; for His mercy endureth for ever.
With a strong hand, and with an upraised arm; for His mercy endureth for ever.
To Him Which divided the Red Sea into parts; for His mercy endureth for ever.
And led Israel through the midst of it; for His mercy endureth for ever.
And overthrew Pharaoh and his host in the Red Sea; for His mercy endureth for ever.
To Him Which led His people through the wilderness; for His mercy endureth for ever.
To Him Which smote great kings; for His mercy endureth for ever.
And slew mighty kings; for His mercy endureth for ever.
Sihon, king of the Amorites; for His mercy endureth for ever.
And Og, the king of Bashan; for His mercy endureth for ever.
And gave their land for an heritage; for His mercy endureth for ever.
Even an heritage unto Israel His servant; for His mercy endureth for ever.
For the Lord remembered us in our low estate; for His mercy endureth for ever.
And hath redeemed us from our enemies; for His mercy endureth for ever.
Who giveth food to all flesh; for His mercy endureth for ever.
O give thanks unto the God of heaven; for His mercy endureth for ever.
By the rivers of Babylon, there we sat down and wept, when we remembered Zion.
We hanged our instruments upon the willows in the midst thereof.
For there they that had taken us captive required of us words of a song.
And they that had carried us away asked us for an hymn, saying, Sing us one of the songs of Zion.
How shall we sing the Lord's song in a strange land?
If I forget thee, O Jerusalem, let my right hand be forgotten.
Let my tongue cleave to my throat if I remember thee not, if I prefer not Jerusalem above all others as my chief joy.
Remember, O Lord, the children of Edom, in the day of Jerusalem; who said, Raze it, raze it, even to the foundations thereof.
O wretched daughter of Babylon, blessed shall he be that shall reward thee as thou hast rewarded us.
Blessed shall he be who shall seize and dash thy little ones against the rock.
I will give Thee thanks, O Lord, with my whole heart: and before angels will I sing praise unto Thee; for Thou hast heard all the words of my mouth.
I will worship toward Thy holy temple, and give thanks unto Thy name, for Thy mercy and Thy truth; for Thou hast magnified Thy holy name above all that is.
In whatsoever day I shall call upon Thee, hear me speedily; Thou shalt endue my soul abundantly with Thy strength.
Let all the kings of the earth give Thee thanks, O Lord, for they have heard all the words of Thy mouth.
Yea, let them sing in the ways of the Lord, for great is the glory of the Lord.
For the Lord is exalted, yet hath He regard unto the lowly; but the proud He knoweth from afar.
Though I walk in the midst of trouble, Thou wilt revive me; Thou hast stretched forth Thine hand against the wrath of mine enemies, and Thy right hand hath saved me.
The Lord shall make recompense for me; Thy mercy, O Lord, endureth for ever; despise not the work of Thy hands.
O Lord, Thou hast proved me, and Thou knowest me. Thou knowest my downsitting and mine uprising; Thou hast understood my thoughts from afar.
Thou hast searched out my path and my lot, and hast foreseen all my ways; for there is no guile upon my tongue.
Behold, O Lord, Thou knowest all things, the last and the first; Thou hast fashioned me, and laid Thine hand upon me.
Thy knowledge is too wonderful for me; it is great, I cannot attain to it.
Whither shall I go from Thy Spirit? and whither shall I flee from Thy presence?
If I ascend up into heaven, Thou art there; if I go down into hell, Thou art there present.
If I take up my wings in the morning, and dwell in the uttermost parts of the sea, even there shall Thy hand lead me, and Thy right hand shall hold me.
And I said, Surely the darkness shall cover me, and in my pleasure shall the night be turned to day.
For darkness will not be darkness with Thee, but night shall be bright as day; as is the darkness, even so shall be the light thereof.
For Thou hast possessed my reins; Thou hast holpen me, O Lord, from my mother's womb.
I will give Thee thanks, for Thou art wondrous and fearful; marvellous are Thy works, and my soul knoweth it right well.
My bones are not hid from Thee, which Thou hast made in secret; nor my substance in the lowest parts of the earth.
Thine eyes did see my substance, yet being unperfect; and in Thy book shall all mankind be written; daily shall they be fashioned, when as yet there be none of them.
Exceeding honoured also are Thy friends unto me, O God! their rule is greatly strengthened.
I will tell them, and they shall be multiplied in number more than the sand; when I awake, I am still with Thee.
Surely Thou wilt slay the sinners, O God! Depart from me, ye bloody men, for Thou shalt say of their thought, They shall take Thy cities in vain.
Have not I hated them, O Lord, that hate Thee? And have I not pined away because of Thine enemies?
I have hated them with a perfect hatred, and they are counted mine enemies.
Prove me, O Lord, and know my heart; try me, and know my ways.
And see if there be any way of wickedness in me, and lead me in the way everlasting.
Rescue me, O Lord, from the evil man; deliver me from the unrighteous man,
Which have imagined injustice in their heart; all the day long have they prepared for war.
They have sharpened their tongues like a serpent; the poison of asps is under their lips.
Keep me, O Lord, from the hand of the sinner; rescue me from the unjust men who have purposed to overthrow my goings.
The proud have hid a snare for me and spread a net with cords for my feet; they have set stumbling blocks for me beside the way.
I said unto the Lord, Thou art my God; give ear unto the voice of my supplication, O Lord.
O Lord, Lord, the strength of my salvation, Thou hast covered my head in the day of battle.
Deliver me not, O Lord, unto the sinner, according to my desire. They have consulted against me; forsake me not, lest they be exalted.
As for the head of those that compass me about, the mischief of their lips shall cover them.
Coals will fall upon them; Thou shalt cast them down into the fire, and they shall not stand in their miseries.
A babbling man shall not prosper upon the earth; evils shall hunt an unrighteous man unto destruction.
I know that the Lord will maintain the cause of the needy, and the right of the poor.
Surely the righteous shall give thanks unto Thy name, and the upright shall dwell in Thy presence.
Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit, both now and ever, and unto the ages of ages. Amen.
Lord, I have cried unto Thee, hear Thou me; give ear unto the voice of my supplication when I cry unto Thee.
Let my prayer be set forth before Thee as incense, the lifting up of my hands as an evening sacrifice.
Set a watch, O Lord, before my mouth, and a door of enclosure about my lips.
Incline not my heart to evil words, to make excuse with pretexts for sins with men that work iniquity; I shall not join with their chosen.
The righteous shall chasten me with mercy, and reprove me; but let not the oil of the sinner anoint my head.
For yet shall my prayer be against their pleasures; their judges have been swallowed up like unto a rock.
They will hear my words, for they are sweet; as when a clod of earth is broken up upon the ground, so have their bones been scattered nigh unto Hades.
But my eyes are unto Thee, Lord, O Lord; in Thee have I hoped; take not away my soul.
Keep me from the snare which they have laid for me, and from the stumbling blocks of the workers of iniquity.
The wicked shall fall into their own net; I am alone until that I pass hence.
I cried unto the Lord with my voice; with my voice unto the Lord did I make supplication.
I will pour out my supplication before Him; I will shew before Him my trouble.
When my spirit was fainting within me, then Thou knewest my paths.
In this way wherein I walked have they privily laid a snare for me.
I looked on my right hand, and beheld; but there was no man that knew me.
Flight failed me, and there is none that watcheth for my soul.
I cried unto Thee, O Lord; I said, Thou art my hope, my portion in the land of the living.
Attend unto my supplication, for I am brought very low.
Deliver me from my persecutors, for they are stronger than I.
Bring my soul out of prison, that I may praise Thy name.
The just shall await me, until Thou shalt reward me.
Hear my prayer, O Lord; give ear unto my supplication in Thy truth; hearken unto me in Thy righteousness.
And enter not into judgment with Thy servant; for in Thy sight shall no man living be justified.
For the enemy hath persecuted my soul; he hath brought my life down to the ground.
He hath sat me in darkness, as those that have been long dead; and my spirit is faint within me, my heart within me is troubled.
I remembered the days of old, I meditated on all Thy works, I mused on the works of Thy hands.
I stretched forth my hands unto Thee; my soul thirsteth after Thee as a thirsty land.
Hear me speedily, O Lord; my spirit waxeth faint.
Turn not away Thy face from me, lest I be like unto them that go down into the pit.
Cause me to hear Thy mercy in the morning, for in Thee do I hope.
Cause me to know, O Lord, the way wherein I should walk, for I lifted up my soul unto Thee.
Rescue me, O Lord, from mine enemies; have I fled unto Thee for refuge. Teach me to do Thy will, for Thou art my God.
Thy good Spirit shall lead me into the land of uprightness; quicken me, O Lord, for Thy name's sake.
In Thy righteousness Thou shalt bring my soul out of trouble, and in Thy mercy Thou shalt destroy my enemies.
And Thou shalt destroy all them that afflict my soul, for I am Thy servant.
Blessed be the Lord my God, Which teacheth my hands to
battle, and my fingers to fight.
My mercy and my refuge; my help and my deliverer.
My defender, in Whom I have hoped; Who hath subdued my people under me.
Lord, what is man, that Thou art made known unto him? or the son of man, that Thou makest account of him?
Man is like unto vanity; his days as a shadow pass away.
Bow the heavens, O Lord, and come down; touch the mountains, and they shall smoke.
Flash forth lightning, and Thou shalt scatter them; send out Thine arrows, and Thou shalt trouble them.
Send out Thine hand from above; rescue me, and deliver me from many waters, from the hand of the sons that are strangers,
Whose mouth hath spoken vanity, and their right hand is the right hand of unrighteousness.
I will sing a new song unto Thee, O God; upon a psaltery of ten strings will I sing praises to Thee;
Who givest salvation unto kings; Who redeemest David Thy servant from the evil sword.
Deliver me, and rescue me from the hand of sons that are strangers, whose mouth hath spoken vanity, and their right hand is the right hand of unrighteousness.
Whose sons are like new plants, strongly planted in their youth; their daughters decked out, adorned after the similitude of a temple.
Their garners, brimming over with all manner of store.
Their sheep fruitful with young, abounding in their gateways; their oxen fat.
There is no breach of wall, nor passage, neither any crying in their streets.
They have called the people blessed whose lot this is; but blessed is that people whose God is the Lord.
I will exalt Thee, O God my king, and I will bless Thy name for ever, yea, for ever and ever.
Every day will I bless Thee, and I will praise Thy name for ever, yea, for ever and ever.
Great is the Lord, and greatly to be praised; and there is no end of His greatness.
Generation and generation shall praise Thy works, and shall declare Thy might.
They shall speak of the majesty of the glory of Thy holiness, and shall tell of Thy wondrous works.
And they shall speak of the might of Thy marvellous acts, and shall tell of Thy majesty.
They shall publish the memory of the abundance of Thy goodness, and shall exult in Thy righteousness.
The Lord is full of compassion, and merciful; longsuffering, and of great mercy.
The Lord is good to all, and His tender mercies are over all His works.
Let all Thy works praise Thee, O Lord, and let Thy saints bless Thee.
They shall speak of the glory of Thy kingdom, and tell of Thy dominion.
To make known to the sons of men Thy dominion, and the glorious majesty of Thy kingdom.
Thy kingdom is an everlasting kingdom, and Thy dominion endureth throughout all generations.
The Lord is faithful in all His words, and holy in all His works.
The Lord upholdeth all that fall, and raiseth up all those that be cast down.
The eyes of all look unto Thee in hope, and Thou givest them their meat in due season.
Thou openest Thine hand, and fillest with Thy favour every living thing.
