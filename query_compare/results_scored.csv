For the Peace of the world,BERT,99.19,Psalter,34,"Judge Thou, O Lord, them that do me injustice; fight against them that fight against me. Take hold of weapon and buckler, and rise up for mine help. Draw out the sword, and stop the way against them that persecute me; say unto my soul, I am Thy salvation. Let them be ashamed and confounded that seek after my soul; let them be turned back and put to shame that devise evil against me. Let them become as chaff before the face of the wind, and let the angel of the Lord afflict them. Let their way be dark and slippery, and let the angel of the Lord pursue them. For without cause have they hid for me destruction in their snare; without cause have they reproached my soul. Let a snare come upon him unawares, and let the snare that he hath hid catch himself; and into that very snare let him fall. But my soul shall exult in the Lord; it shall delight in His salvation. All my bones shall say, Lord, O Lord, who is like unto Thee, Which deliverest the poor from the hand of them that are too strong for him, yea, the poor and needy from them that spoil him? Unjust witnesses did rise up; they charged me with things that I knew not. They rewarded me evil for good, and barrenness to my soul. But as for me, when they troubled me, I put on sackcloth, and humbled my soul with fasting; and my prayer shall return into mine own bosom. I sought to please, as though it had been my neighbour or brother; I humbled myself, as one that is mourning and sad of countenance. But they rejoiced against me, and gathered themselves together; plagues were gathered together upon me, and I knew it not. They were scattered, yet they were not pricked at the heart. They tempted me, they scoffed at me with scorn, they gnashed upon me with their teeth. Lord, when wilt Thou look upon me? Rescue my soul from their mischief, mine onlybegotten one from the lions. I will give Thee thanks in the great congregation; I will praise Thee among a mighty people. Let not them that are my enemies wrongfully rejoice over me, they that hate me without a cause, and wink with the eyes. For they spake unto me peaceably indeed, but in their anger they devised deceits. Yea, they opened their mouth wide against me; they said, Aha, aha, our eyes have seen it. This Thou hast seen, O Lord, keep not silence; O Lord, be not far from me. Arise, O Lord, and attend to my judgment, even unto my cause, my God and my Lord. Judge me, O Lord, according to Thy righteousness; let them not rejoice over me, O Lord my God. Let them not say in their hearts, Aha, aha, it is well to our soul; neither let them say, We have swallowed him up. Let them be ashamed and brought to confusion together that rejoice at my woes. Let them be clothed with shame and confusion that speak great words against me. Let them exult and be glad, that favour my righteous cause; yea, let them that desire the peace of Thy servant say continually, Let the Lord be magnified. And my tongue shall speak of Thy righteousness, and of Thy praise all the day long.",10.0
For the Peace of the world,BERT,99.11,Bible,18,For the End a psalm by David The heavens declare the glory of God The firmament shows the creation of His hands Day to day utters speech And night to night reveals knowledge There is no speech nor language Where their voices are not heard Their proclamation went forth into all the earth And their words to the ends of the world In the sun He set His tabernacle And it rejoices exceedingly Like a bridegroom coming forth from his bridal chamber Like a strong man to run a race Its rising is from one end of heaven And its circuit runs to the other end And nothing shall be hidden from its heat The law of the Lord is blameless converting souls The testimony of the Lord is trustworthy making children wise The ordinances of the Lord are right rejoicing the heart The commandment of the Lord is bright enlightening the eyes The fear of the Lord is pure enduring unto ages of ages The judgments of the Lord are true being altogether just More to be desired are they than gold and a very precious stone Sweeter also than honey and the honeycomb For indeed Your servant keeps them In keeping them there is great reward Who will understand his transgressions Cleanse me from hidden sins And spare your servant from unnatural sins If they have no dominion over me then I shall be blameless And I shall be cleansed from great sin Let the words of my mouth and the meditation of my heart Be always pleasing before You O Lord my helper and my redeemer,8.0
For the Peace of the world,BERT,99.11,Psalter,49,"The God of gods, even the Lord, hath spoken, and called the earth from the rising of the sun unto the going down thereof. Out of Zion is the comeliness of His beauty. God, our God, shall come manifestly, and shall not keep silence. A fire shall burn before Him, and a mighty tempest shall be round about Him. He shall summon the heaven above, and the earth, that He may judge His people. Gather His saints together unto Him, those that have established His covenant upon sacrifices. And the heavens shall declare His righteousness; for God is judge. Hear, O My people, and I will speak to thee, O Israel; and I will testify against thee; I am God, even thy God. I will not reprove thee for sacrifices, for thy whole burntofferings are continually before Me. I will not welcome bullocks out of thy house, nor he goats out of thy flocks. For all the beasts of the field are Mine, the cattle upon the mountains, and the oxen. I know all the fowls of the air, and the beauty of the fields is Mine. If I were hungry, I would not tell thee, for the world is Mine, and the fulness thereof. Will I eat the flesh of bulls, or drink the blood of goats? Offer unto God a sacrifice of praise, and pay thy vows unto the Most High. And call upon me in the day of thy trouble, and I will deliver thee; and thou shalt glorify Me. But unto the sinner God said, Why dost thou declare My statutes, and takest My covenant in thy mouth? Thou hast hated instruction, and hast cast My words behind thee. When thou sawest a thief, then thou didst run with him, and hast been partaker with the adulterer. Thy mouth hath multiplied evil, and thy tongue hath framed deceits. Thou satest and spakest against thy brother, and laidst a scandal against thy mother's son. These things hast thou done, and I kept silence. Thou thoughtest wickedly that I should be like unto thee; but I will reprove thee, and set thy sins before thy face. Now understand this, ye that forget God, lest He snatch you away, and there be none to deliver. A sacrifice of praise shall glorify Me, and there is the way wherein I will shew him My salvation.",5.0

For the Peace of the world,BERT,99.09,Psalter,43,"We have heard with our ears, O God, for our fathers have told us, what work Thou didst in their days, in the days of old. Thine hand didst destroy the heathen, and Thou plantedst them in their stead; Thou didst bring evils upon those peoples, and cast them out. For they got not the land in possession by their own sword, neither did their own arm save them. But Thy right hand, and Thine arm, and the light of Thy countenance, because Thou hadst a favour unto them. Thou art Thyself my King and my God, that commandest the salvation of Jacob. Through Thee shall the horn of our strength push down our enemies, and through Thy name will we bring them to nought that rise up against us. For I will not hope in my bow, neither shall my sword save me. For Thou hast saved us from them that afflict us, and hast put them to shame that hated us. In God shall we boast all the day long, and in Thy name shall we give praise for ever. But now Thou hast cast us off, and put us to shame; and Thou, O God wilt not go forth with our armies. Thou hast made us to turn back before our enemies, and they which hated us spoiled for themselves. Thou hast given us like sheep appointed to be eaten, and hast scattered us among the heathen. Thou hast sold Thy people for nought, and there was no profit in our selling. Thou hast made us a reproach to our neighbours, a scorn and derision to them that are round about us. Thou hast made us a byword among the heathen, a shaking of the head among the peoples. All the day long my disgrace is before me, and the shame of my face hath covered me, For the voice of him that reproacheth and revileth, by reason of the enemy and pursuer. All this is come upon us, yet have we not forgotten Thee, neither have we dealt unrighteously in Thy covenant. And our heart is not turned back, but Thou hast turned aside our paths from Thy ways. For Thou hast humbled us in a place of affliction, and the shadow of death hath covered us. If we have forgotten the name of our God, and if we have stretched out our hands to a strange god, Shall not God search this out? for He knoweth the secrets of the heart. For Thy sake are we killed all the day long; we are counted as sheep for the slaughter. Awake, why sleepest Thou, O Lord? arise, and cast us not off for ever. Wherefore turnest Thou Thy face away? forgettest Thou our poverty and affliction? For our soul is brought down to the dust; our belly hath cleaved unto the earth. Arise, O Lord, help us, and redeem us for Thy name's sake.",

For the Peace of the world,SBERT,96.17,Psalter,105,"O give thanks unto the Lord, for He is good; for His mercy endureth for ever. Who shall utter the mighty acts of the Lord? Who shall make all His praises to be heard? Blessed are they that keep judgment, and do righteousness at all times. Remember us, O Lord, with Thy favour that Thou bearest untor Thy people; O visit us with Thy salvation. That we may see the good of Thy chosen, that we may be glad in the gladness of Thy nation, that we may glory with Thine inheritance. We have sinned with our fathers, we have committed iniquity, we have done unrighteously. Our fathers understood not Thy wonders in Egypt, and they remembered not the multitude of Thy mercy; but provoked Thee as they went up by the Red Sea. Nevertheless He saved them for His name's sake, that He might make His mighty power to be known. He rebuked the Red Sea also, and it was dried up; so He led them into the depths, as in a wilderness. And He saved them from the hand of him that hated them, and redeemed them from the hand of the enemy. The waters covered those that afflicted them; there was not one of them left. Then believed they His words, and sang His praise. They made haste, they forgat His works, they waited not for His counsel; But lusted exceedingly in the wilderness, and tempted God in the place without water. And He gave them their request, and sent fulness into their souls. They provoked Moses also in the camp, and Aaron, the holy one of the Lord. The earth opened and swallowed up Dathan, and covered the company of Abiram. And a fire was kindled in their company; a flame burned up the wicked. And they made a calf in Horeb, and worshipped the graven thing. Thus they changed His glory into the likeness of a calf that eateth grass. And they forgat God who had saved them, who had done great things in Egypt, Wondrous works in the land of Ham, terrible things at the Red Sea. And He said that He would destroy them, had not Moses His chosen stood before Him in the breach, to turn away His wrath, lest He should destroy them. Yea, they despised the desirable land; they believed not His word; But murmured in their tents; they hearkened not unto the voice of the Lord. Therefore He lifted up His hand against them, to overthrow them in the wilderness; to overthrow their seed also among the nations, and to scatter them in the lands. They were made initiates also of Baalpeor, and ate the sacrifices of the dead. And they provoked Him to anger with their inventions, and destruction was multiplied among them. And Phinehas stood up and made propitiation, and the plague abated. And that was counted to him for righteousness, from generation to generation for evermore. They provoked Him also at the waters of strife, and Moses was hurt for their sakes. Because they provoked his spirit, and he spake unadvisedly with his lips. They did not destroy the nations, concerning whom the Lord commanded them; But were mingled among the heathen, and learned their works; and they served their graven things, and it became a scandal unto them. Yea, they sacrificed their sons and their daughters unto demons, and shed innocent blood, even the blood of their sons and of their daughters, whom they sacrificed unto the graven things of Canaan. And the land was murderously defiled with blood, and it was polluted with their own works, and they went a whoring with their own inventions. Therefore was the wrath of the Lord kindled against His people, and He abhorred His own inheritance. And He gave them into the hands of their enemies, and they that hated them had dominion over them. Their enemies also afflicted them, and they were brought into subjection under their hand. Many times did He deliver them, but they provoked Him with their counsel, and were brought low in their iniquities. Nevertheless the Lord regarded them in their affliction, and heard their supplication. And He remembered His covenant, and repented according to the multitude of His mercy. He made them to be pitied in the sight of all those that had taken them captive. Save us, O Lord our God, and gather us from among the heathen, that we may give thanks to Thy holy name, that we may glory in Thy praise. Blessed be the God of Israel, from everlasting to everlasting; and all the peoples shall say, So be it, so be it.",0.0

Deep calleth unto deep at the voice of Thy cataracts; all Thy waves and Thy billows are gone over me. The Lord will command His mercy in the daytime, and in the night a song to Him; with me is prayer unto the God of my life. I will say unto God, Thou art my helper; why hast Thou forgotten me, and why go I mourning while mine enemy oppresseth me? While my bones were broken, mine enemies reproached me, while they said daily unto me, Where is thy God? Why art thou cast down, O my soul, and why dost thou disquiet me?

And who shall tell my Lord? The Lord Himself shall hear. He sent His angel, and took me from my father's sheep, and anointed me with the oil of His anointing. My brethren were comely and tall, but the Lord took not pleasure in them. I went forth to meet the Philistine, and he cursed me by his idols. But I drew his own sword, and cut off his head; and I took away the reproach from the sons of Israel. THE NINE ODES THE FIRST ODE An Ode of Moses in the Exodus. (Exodus 15: 119) When he had altogether drowned Pharaoh in the deep, Moses said, Let us sing unto the Lord, for He is gloriously glorified. Let us sing unto the Lord, for He is gloriously glorified; the horse and his rider hath He thrown into the sea. He was to me a helper and protector for salvation. He is my God, and I will glorify Him; my father's God, and I will exalt Him. The Lord breaking wars; LORD is His name. Pharaoh's chariots and his hosts hath He cast into the sea; the chosen mounted captains hath He plunged into the Red Sea. He covered them with the sea; they sank into the depths as a stone. Thy right hand, O Lord, is glorified in strength; Thy right hand, O Lord, hath dashed in pieces the enemy; and in the abundance of Thy glory hast Thou crushed the adversaries. Thou sentest forth Thy wrath; it consumed them as stubble. And through the breath of Thine anger the waters parted asunder; the waters were congealed as a wall, the waves were congealed in the midst of the sea. For 14 verses The enemy said, I will pursue, I will overtake, I will divide the spoil, I will satisfy my soul, I will destroy with my sword; my right hand shall have the dominion. Thou sentest forth Thy wind, the sea covered them; they sank as lead in the mighty water. For 12 verses Who is like unto Thee, O Lord, among the gods? Who is like Thee, glorious in holiness, marvellous in glories, doing wonders? Thou stretchedst out Thy right hand; the earth swallowed them. For 10 verses Thou in Thy righteousness hast guided this Thy people which Thou hast redeemed; Thou calledst them in Thy strength to Thy holy habitation. The nations heard, and were angry; pangs took hold upon the inhabitants of Philistia. For 8 verses Then the princes of Edom made haste, the princes also of the Moabites; trembling took hold upon them; all the inhabitants of Canaan melted away. Let fear and trembling fall upon them; by the greatness of Thine arm let them become as stone, For 6 verses Till Thy people pass over, O Lord; till they pass over, this people, which Thou hast purchased. Bring them in, and plant them in the mountain of Thine inheritance; in the place, O Lord, which Thou hast made for Thee to dwell in, in the sanctuary which Thy hands have prepared. For 4 verses The Lord reigneth for ever and ever. For the horse of Pharaoh went in with his chariots and with his horsemen into the sea, and the Lord brought again the waters of the sea upon them; but the children of Israel went on dry ground in the midst of the sea. Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit, both now and ever, and unto the ages of ages. Amen. THE SECOND ODE It should be noted that the Second Ode is never chanted, except only in Great Lent, during which on Tuesday only it is chanted to the end. And for each of the troparia of the Second Ode of the Canon we say, Glory to Thee, our God, glory to Thee. An Ode of Moses in the Deuteronomy. (Deut. 32: 143) After the Law had been written, again an Ode of Moses. Attend, O ye heaven, and I will speak; and let the earth hear the words of my mouth. Let my teaching be looked for as the rain, and let my words come down as the dew, as a shower upon the grass, and as the snow upon the green herb. For I have called upon the name of the Lord. Ascribe ye majesty unto our God. As for our God, His works are true, and all His ways are judgment. God is faithful, and there is no unrighteousness in Him; just and holy is the Lord. Have not children that are blameworthy sinned against Him? O perverse and crooked generation, do ye thus requite the Lord? This is a foolish people, and unwise; did not He Himself thy Father take thee for His own, and make thee, and fashion thee? Remember the days of old, consider the years of generations and generations. Ask thy father, and he will shew thee; thine elders, and they will tell thee. When the Most High divided the nations, when He scattered the sons of Adam, He set the bounds of the nations according to the number of the angels of God. And Jacob His people became the Lord's portion; Israel was the lot of His inheritance. He satisfied him in the wilderness, in burning thirst, and in a waterless land. He led him about, He instructed him, He kept him as the apple of His eye. As an eagle watcheth over his nest, and yearneth over his young, and spreading abroad his wings, receiveth them, and taketh them up upon his back; So the Lord alone did lead them, and there was no strange God with them. He brought them up on the strength of the land; He fed them with the increase of the fields. He suckled them with honey out of the rock, and oil out of the solid rock, Butter of kine, and milk of sheep, with fat of lambs and rams, of calves and kids, with the fat of kidneys of wheat; and they drank wine, the blood of the grape. So Jacob ate, and was filled; and the beloved one kicked, he waxed fat, he grew thick and broad; then he forsook God Which made him, and departed from God his Saviour. They provoked Me to anger with strange gods, and embittered Me with their abominations. They sacrificed unto demons, not to God; to gods whom they knew not; to new gods recently arisen, whom their fathers knew not. Thou hast forsaken God that begat thee, and hast forgotten God that feedeth thee.",5.0

Verses where the psalmist remembers past deliverance and uses it to find hope in present trials.,TFIDF_GLoVe,20.02,Psalter,103,"Bless the Lord, O my soul. O Lord my God, Thou art become exceeding magnified. Thou hast put on praise and majesty, Who coverest Thyself with light as with a garment, Who stretchest out the heavens like a curtain; Who supporteth His chambers in the waters. Who appointeth the clouds for His ascent; who walketh upon the wings of the wind. Who maketh His angels spirits, and His ministers a flaming fire. Who hath established the earth upon its sure foundation; it shall not be moved for ever and ever. The deep like a garment is his mantle; the waters shall stand upon the mountains. At Thy rebuke they shall flee; at the voice of Thy thunder they shall be afraid. The mountains rise up, and the plains go down unto the place which Thou hast founded for them. Thou hast set a bound that they shall not pass over, neither turn again to cover the earth. He sendeth the springs into the valleys; the waters shall run among the mountains. They shall give drink to all the beasts of the field; the wild asses shall wait to quench their thirst. By them shall the fowls of the air make their habitation; they shall give voice from the midst of the rocks. He watereth the mountains from His chambers; the earth shall be satisfied with the fruit of Thy works. He causeth the grass to grow for the cattle, and green herb for the service of men. That he may bring forth bread out of the earth: and wine maketh glad the heart of man. To make his face cheerful with oil: and bread strengtheneth man's heart. The trees of the plain shall be satisfied, the cedars of Lebanon which Thou hast planted. There shall the sparrows make their nests; the house of the heron is chief among them. The high mountains are a refuge for the harts, and so is the rock for the hares. He hath made the moon for seasons; the sun knoweth his going down. Thou appointedst darkness, and there was night, wherein all the beasts of the forest shall go abroad. Young lions roaring after their prey, and seeking their meat from God. The sun ariseth, and they are gathered together, and they shall lay them down in their dens. But man shall go forth unto his work, and to his labour until the evening. O Lord, how magnified are Thy works! In wisdom hast Thou made them all; the earth is filled with Thy creation. So is this great and wide sea, wherein are things creeping innumerable, creatures small and great. There go the ships, there this dragon, whom Thou hast made to play therein. All things look unto Thee, that Thou mayest give them their meat in due season. When Thou givest it them, they shall gather it; when Thou openest Thine hand, all things shall be filled with goodness. When Thou turnest away Thy face, they shall be troubled; Thou shalt take away their breath, and they shall fail, and return to their dust. Thou shalt send forth Thy Spirit, and they shall be created, and Thou shalt renew the face of the earth. Let the glory of the Lord endure unto the ages; the Lord shall rejoice in His works. He looketh upon the earth, and maketh it tremble; He toucheth the mountains, and they smoke. I will sing unto the Lord as long as I live, I will sing praise to my God while I have my being. Let my words be pleasing unto Him; and I will be glad in the Lord. O that sinners might be consumed out of the earth, and the workers of iniquity, so that they be no more. Bless thou the Lord, O my soul. Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit, both now and ever, and unto the ages of ages. Amen. Alleluia, alleluia, alleluia, glory to Thee, O God. Alleluia, alleluia, alleluia, glory to Thee, O God. Alleluia, alleluia, alleluia, glory to thee, O God.

Thou that sittest upon the Cherubim, shew Thyself before Ephraim, Benjamin and Manasseh. Stir up Thy might, and come to save us. Turn us again, O God, and cause Thy face to shine, and we shall be saved. O Lord God of hosts, how long wilt Thou be angry against the prayer of Thy servants? Wilt Thou feed us with the bread of tears, and give us tears to drink in great measure? Thou hast made us a strife among our neighbours, and our enemies have scoffed at us. Turn us again, O Lord of hosts, and cause Thy face to shine; and we shall be saved. Thou hast brought a vine out of Egypt; Thou hast cast out the heathen, and planted it. Thou preparedst the way before it, and Thou plantedst the roots thereof, and it filled the earth. The shadows thereof covered the mountains, and the boughs thereof the cedars of God. She stretched forth her shoots unto the sea, and her branches unto the rivers. Why hast Thou broken down her hedge, and all they that pass by the way do pluck the fruit? The boar out of the wood hath wasted it, and the wild beast hath devoured it. Turn again, O God of hosts; and look down from heaven, and behold, and visit this vine. And perfect that which Thy right hand hath planted, and look upon the son of man, whom Thou hast made strong for Thyself. It is burned with fire, and digged up; they shall perish at the rebuke of Thy countenance. Let Thy hand be upon the man of Thy right hand, and upon the son of man whom Thou madest strong for Thyself. And we will not depart from Thee; Thou shalt quicken us, and we will call upon Thy name. Turn us again, O Lord God of hosts; and cause Thy face to shine; and we shall be saved.",

Great is our Lord, and great is His power; and His understanding is infinite. The Lord lifteth up the meek, but casteth the sinners down to the ground. Begin your song unto the Lord with thanksgiving; sing praise upon the harp unto our God, Who covereth the heavens with clouds, Who prepareth rain for the earth, Who maketh grass to grow upon the mountains, and green herb for the service of man, Who giveth to the beasts their food, and to the young ravens which call upon Him. He shall not delight in the strength of an horse, neither taketh He pleasure in the legs of a man. The Lord taketh pleasure in them that fear Him, and in those that hope in His mercy.",
