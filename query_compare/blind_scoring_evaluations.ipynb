    "# Working through the Blind Scoring\n",
    "\n",
    "After taking the 8 quieres and running then through the four different queries from a previous notebook, I was able to blind score each result that was attached to one of the queries. I scored them on a scale of 0 - 10, with:\n",
    "- **0** – No semantic relationship  \n",
    "- **1–3** – Minimal semantic overlap  \n",
    "- **4–6** – Partial or contextual relevance  \n",
    "- **7–9** – Strong semantic alignment  \n",
    "- **10** – Exact or near-exact semantic match \n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook will now closely lopok my my blind scoring in a couple of different ways. "
